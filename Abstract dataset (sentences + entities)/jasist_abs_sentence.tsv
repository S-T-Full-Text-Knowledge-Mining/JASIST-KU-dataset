Research method	A framework is developed that supports the theoretical design of an organizational memory information system ( OMIS ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"The framework provides guidance for managing the processing capabilities of an organization by matching knowledge location , flexibility , and processing requirements with data architecture ."
Research method	This framework is tested using three different sets of data attributes and data architectures from 147 business professionals that have experience in IS development .
Research findings/conclusions	We find that tradeoffs exist between the amount of knowledge embedded in the data architecture and the flexibility of data architectures .
Research findings/conclusions	This trade-off is contingent on the characteristics of the set of tasks that the data architecture is being designed to support .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , the match is important to consider in the design of OMIS database architecture ."
Research questions	"Here we hypothesize that impact-factor boosting ( unethical behavior documented previously in several underperforming journals ) should not be considered as exceptional , but that it affects even the top-tier journals ."
Research method	We performed a citation analysis of documents recently published in 11 prominent general science and biomedical journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"In these journals , only 12 to 79 % of what they publish was considered original research , whereas editorial materials alone constituted 11 to 44 % of the total document types published ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Citations to commissioned opinion articles comprised 3 to 15 % of the total citations to the journals within 3 postpublication years , with even a higher share occurring during the first postpublication year ."
Research findings/conclusions	An additional 4 to 15 % of the citations were received by the journals from commissioned opinion articles published in other journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Combined , the parallel world of uncitable documents was responsible for up to 30 % of the total citations to the top-tier journals , with the highest values found for medical science journals ( New England Journal of Medicine , JAMA , and the Lancet ) and lower values found for the Science , Nature , and Cell series journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	Self-citations to some of the top-tier journals reach values higher than the total citation counts accumulated by papers in most of the Web of Science-indexed journals .
Research method	Most of the self-citations were generated by commissioned opinion articles .
Research findings/conclusions	The parallel world of supposedly uncitable documents flourishes and severely distorts the commonly used scientometric indicators .
Research questions	"The main argument in such literature is that citizen science has many advantages , not only for scientists and the science that is produced , but also for the participating citizens ."
Research questions	"As a result of this line of reasoning , the main issue becomes : How we can facilitate citizen science , and help it expand to more projects , and involve more ( types of ) participants ?"
Research questions	"My aim in this opinion paper is to make 2 points : First , that most recent work on citizen science fails to elaborate on the new types of relationships , practices , and interactions that are facilitated by information and communication technologies , when compared to traditional volunteer science ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The second point is that there are pronounced disciplinary differences among citizen science projects , something that , again , is generally being missed in much recent work ."
Research findings/conclusions	Missing these points can lead us to imagine that it 's only a matter of time ( and of course funding ) before all sciences catch up with citizen science .
Research questions	"Such a line of thought can result in investing resources ( money , time , effort ) in projects and infrastructures that are doomed to fail , because of their topic or field of research ."
Research questions	I conclude by offering some thoughts on a research agenda .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The effect of hybrid open access on citation counts and author behavior in the field of chemistry is something that has not been widely studied .
Research method	"We compared 814 open access articles and 27,621 subscription access articles published from 2006 through 2011 in American Chemical Society journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As expected , the 2 comparison groups are not equal in all respects ."
Research method	Cumulative citation data were analyzed from years 2-5 following an article 's publication date .
Research findings/conclusions	"A citation advantage for open access articles was correlated with the journal impact factor ( IF ) in low and medium IF journals , but not in high IF journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Open access articles have a 24 % higher mean citation rate than their subscription counterparts in low IF journals ( confidence limits 8-42 % , p = .0022 ) and similarly , a 26 % higher mean citation rate in medium IF journals ( confidence limits 14-40 % , p < .001 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Open access articles in high IF journals had no significant difference compared to subscription access articles ( 13 % lower mean citation rate , confidence limits -27-3 % , p = .10 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These results are correlative , not causative , and may not be completely due to an open access effect ."
Research method	"Authors of the open access articles were also surveyed to determine why they chose a hybrid open access option , paid the required article processing charge , and whether they believed it was money well spent ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Authors primarily chose open access because of funding mandates ; however , most considered the money well spent because open access increases information access to the scientific community and the general public , and potentially increases citations to their scholarship ."
Research method	This article investigates the extent to which academics exploit journalism using content and citation analyses of online BBC News stories cited by Scopus articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"A total of 27,234 Scopus-indexed publications have cited at least one BBC News story , with a steady annual increase ."
Research findings/conclusions	Citations from the arts and humanities ( 2.8 % of publications in 2015 ) and social sciences ( 1.5 % ) were more likely than citations from medicine ( 0.1 % ) and science ( < 0.1 % ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Surprisingly , half of the sampled Scopus-cited science and technology ( 53 % ) and medicine and health ( 47 % ) stories were based on academic research , rather than otherwise unpublished information , suggesting that researchers have chosen a lower-quality secondary source for their citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , the BBC News stories that were most frequently cited by Scopus , Google Books , and Wikipedia introduced new information from many different topics , including politics , business , economics , statistics , and reports about events ."
Research questions	"Thus , news stories are mediating real-world knowledge into the academic domain , a potential cause for concern ."
Research questions	"When policy-makers call for interdisciplinarity , however , they often mean synergy ."
Research questions	Synergy is generated when the whole offers more possibilities than the sum of its parts .
Research findings/conclusions	"An increase in the number of options above the sum of the options in subsets can be measured as redundancy ; that is , the number of not-yet-realized options ."
Research findings/conclusions	The number of options available to an innovation system for realization can be as decisive for the system 's survival as the historically already-realized innovations .
Research findings/conclusions	"Unlike interdisciplinarity , synergy can also be generated in sectorial or geographical collaborations ."
Research questions	"The measurement of synergy , however , requires a methodology different from the measurement of interdisciplinarity ."
Research questions	"In this study , we discuss recent advances in the operationalization and measurement of interdisciplinarity , and propose a methodology for measuring synergy based on information theory ."
Research questions	The sharing of meanings attributed to information from different perspectives can increase redundancy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Increasing redundancy reduces the relative uncertainty , for example , in niches ."
Research findings/conclusions	The operationalization of the two concepts-interdisciplinarity and synergy-as different and partly overlapping indicators allows for distinguishing between the effects and the effectiveness of science-policy interventions in research priorities .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper studies the problem of leveraging the context of the items presented to the user in a user/system interaction session to improve the recommender system 's ranking prediction .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a novel model that incorporates the opportunity cost of giving up the other items in the session and computes session-specific relevance values for items for context-aware recommendation .
Research findings/conclusions	The model can work on a variety of different problems settings with emphasis on implicit user feedback as it supports varying levels of ordinal relevance .
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of our new model with respect to the ranking quality .
Research method	We analyzed the current state of the iSchool community in the U.S. with a special focus on the evolution of the community .
Research method	"We conducted our study from the perspectives of acquiring talents and producing research , including the analysis on iSchool faculty members ' educational backgrounds , research topics , and the hiring network among iSchools ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Applying text mining techniques and social network analysis to data from various sources , our research revealed how the iSchool community gradually built its own identity over time , including the growing number of faculty members who received their doctorates from the field that studies information , the deviation from computer science and library science , the rising emphasis on the intersection of information , technology , and people , and the increasing educational and research homogeneity as a community ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions suggest that iSchools in the U.S. are evolving into a mature and independent discipline with a more established identity .
Research questions	"In CIS , collaborative sensemaking is an important but understudied aspect ."
Research findings/conclusions	A thorough understanding of collaborative sensemaking behavior in CIS tasks is essential to develop tools to support collaborative sensemaking activities in CIS .
Research method	"In this article , we investigate the general patterns and differences in collaborative sensemaking behavior in travel planning and topic research tasks using the data from 2 observational user studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show the common stages of the collaborative sensemaking process and the differences in users ' collaborative sensemaking strategies and activities between the 2 tasks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This comparative study enhances our understanding of the collaborative sensemaking process in CIS tasks and the differences in user 's sensemaking behavior according to tasks , and describes implications for supporting collaborative sensemaking behavior in CIS tasks ."
Research questions	"Drawing upon self-determination theory , we investigate 2 forms of motivation : internally driven ( autonomous motivation ) and externally driven ( controlled motivation ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Knowledge sharing could be viewed as a required in-role activity or as discretionary extra-role behavior .
Research questions	"In this study , we examine the moderating effect of role perceptions on the relations between each of the two motivational constructs and knowledge sharing , paying particular attention to the affordances of the enabling information technology ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An analysis of survey data from a wiki-based organizational encyclopedia in a large , multinational firm reveals that when contributors ' motivation is externally driven , they are more likely to share knowledge if this activity is viewed as in-role behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , when contributors ' motivation is internally driven , they are more likely to participate in knowledge sharing when this activity is viewed as extra-role behavior ."
Research method	Theoretical and practical implications are discussed .
Research questions	"In response to Dodd-Frank , a series of rules relating to swaps record keeping have been issued , and one such rule calls for the creation of a financial products classification system ."
Research findings/conclusions	The manner in which financial products are classified will have a profound effect on data integration and analysis in the financial industry .
Research findings/conclusions	This article considers various approaches that can be taken when classifying financial products and recommends the use of facet analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	The article argues that this type of analysis is flexible enough to accommodate multiple viewpoints and rigorous enough to facilitate inferences that are based on the hierarchical structure .
Research method	Various use cases are examined that pertain to the organization of financial products .
Research findings/conclusions	The use cases confirm the practical utility of taxonomies that are designed according to faceted principles .
Research method	An intellectual structure consists of clusters of related documents ascribed to individual factors .
Research findings/conclusions	Documents ascribed to a factor are generally associated with a common research theme .
Research findings/conclusions	"As such , the contents of documents ascribed to a factor are theorized to be similar to each other ."
Research findings/conclusions	This study shows that the link-based relatedness implies content-based similarity .
Research method	The intellectual structures of two research domains were derived from data sets retrieved from the Microsoft Academic Search database .
Research method	"The collection of documents ascribed to a factor is referred to as a factor-based document cluster , which the content-based document clusters are compared with ."
Research method	"All documents in an intellectual structure are re-clustered based on their content similarity , which is derived from the cosine of their vector form encoded in documents ' term frequency inverse document frequency ( TF-IDF ) weighted terms ."
Research method	The factor-based document clusters are then compared with the content-based clusters for congruity .
Research method	We used the Rand index and kappa coefficient to check the congruity between the factor-based and content-based document clusters .
Research findings/conclusions	The kappa coefficient indicates that there is fair to moderate agreement between the clusters derived from these two different bases .
Research findings/conclusions	The mixing of research methods requires an epistemological framework that embraces the reality uncovered by different research methods .
Research method	"Three formal ontological categories are introduced for deconstructing the polarized view of reality in objectivism and relativism and for differentiating the nature and characteristics of objective , subjective , and normative validity claims as well as the conditions for justifying objectivity in social research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The characterization of information as objective , subjective , and normative-evaluative simultaneously demands the study of conditions of information-related phenomena that may call for mixed methods research in library and information science ."
Research questions	"Current theories and tools are directed at finding a paper or website , not gaining an understanding of the key papers , authors , controversies , and hypotheses ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This report presents an effort to integrate statistics , text analytics , and visualization in a multiple coordinated window environment that supports exploration ."
Research method	"Our prototype system , Action Science Explorer ( ASE ) , provides an environment for demonstrating principles of coordination and conducting iterative usability tests of them with interested and knowledgeable users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We developed an understanding of the value of reference management , statistics , citation text extraction , natural language summarization for single and multiple documents , filters to interactively select key papers , and network visualization to see citation patterns and identify clusters ."
Research method	A three-phase usability study guided our revisions to ASE and led us to improve the testing methods .
Research method	"The present study evaluates how three sets of employee characteristics ( demographic , company-specific , and skills-based ) predict an employee 's likelihood of becoming a security breach victim ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In order to move beyond traditional evaluations of security threats , which generally consider security threats individually , analyses in this paper approach security vulnerability from a more holistic approach to analyze four risk categories concurrently : phishing , passwords , bring your own device ( BYOD ) , and company-supplied laptops ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions from a survey of 250 employees at a medium-sized American information technology ( IT ) consulting firm identify higher-risk employees across the four risk areas and provide new insights into the challenges organizations face when trying to ensure the protection of company data .
Research findings/conclusions	The matching allows exploiting the rich and controlled vocabulary of medical subject headings ( MeSH ) of Medline/PubMed with additional fields of WoS .
Research method	"The integration provides data ( e.g. , citation data , list of cited reference , list of the addresses of authors ' host organizations , WoS subject categories ) to perform a variety of scientometric analyses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This brief communication describes medlineR , the method on which it relies , and the steps the user should follow to perform the matching across the two databases ."
Research questions	"To demonstrate the differences from Leydesdorff and Opthof ( Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology , 64 ( 5 ) , 1076-1080 ) , we conclude this artcle by testing the routine on the MeSH category Burgada syndrome ."
Research questions	"Recently , digital technology and Internet file sharing led to the delocalization of professional recording studios and the decline of traditional record companies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A direct consequence of this new paradigm is that studio professions found themselves in a transitional phase , needing to be reinvented ."
Research questions	"To understand the scope of these recent technological advances , we first offer an overview of musical recording culture and history and show how studio recordings became a sophisticated form of musical artwork that differed from concert representations ."
Research questions	We then trace the economic evolution of the recording industry through technological advances and present positive and negative impacts of the decline of the traditional business model on studio practices and professions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we report Research findings/conclusions from interviews with six world-renowned record producers reflecting on their recording approaches , the impact of recent technological advances on their careers , and the future of their profession ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Interviewees appreciate working on a wider variety of projects than they have in the past , but they all discuss trade-offs between artistic expectations and budget constraints in the current paradigm ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our investigations converge to show that studio professionals have adjusted their working settings to the new economic situation , although they still rely on the same aesthetic approaches as in the traditional business model to produce musical recordings ."
Research questions	"While literature increasingly establishes that people consult multiple information sources in disaster situations , little is known about the patterns in which multiple media and personal network sources are combined simultaneously and sequentially across decision-making phases ."
Research method	"We address this gap using survey data collected from households in Jacksonville , Florida affected by 2016 's Hurricane Matthew ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results direct attention to perceived consistency of information as a key predictor of uncertainty regarding hurricane impact and evacuation logistics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Frequently utilizing National Weather Service , national and local TV channels , and personal network contacts contributed to higher perceived consistency of information , while the use of other local and online sources was associated with lower perceived consistency ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , combining a larger number of media and official sources predicted higher levels of perceived information consistency ."
Research findings/conclusions	One 's perception of information amount did not significantly explain uncertainty .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study contributes to the theorizing of individuals ' information environment from the perspective of media and network multiplexity and provides practical implications regarding the need of information coordination for improved evacuation decision-making .
Research questions	Previous studies show that users search such content regularly but are often dissatisfied with current search facilities .
Research questions	"We argue that an enhanced understanding of the motivations for search would aid the design of improved search systems , better reflecting what people need ."
Research method	"Building on previous research , we present qualitative analyses of two sources of data regarding how and why people search Twitter ."
Research method	"The first , a diary study ( p=68 ) , provides descriptions of Twitter information needs ( n=117 ) and important meta-data from active study participants ."
Research method	The second data set was established by collecting first-person descriptions of search behavior ( n=388 ) tweeted by twitter users themselves ( p=381 ) and complements the first data set by providing similar descriptions from a more plentiful source .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of our analyses reveal numerous characteristics of Twitter search that differentiate it from more commonly studied search domains , such as web search ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions also shed light on some of the difficulties users encounter .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By highlighting examples that go beyond those previously published , this article adds to the understanding of how and why people search such content ."
Research questions	"Based on these new insights , we conclude with a discussion of possible design implications for search systems that index micro-blogging content ."
Research findings/conclusions	Noticeably missing from this metadata are classifications of visual style-despite the overwhelmingly visual nature of most video games and the interest in visual style among video game users .
Research questions	"One explanation for this paucity is the difficulty in eliciting consistent judgements about visual style , likely due to subjective interpretations of terminology and a lack of demonstrable testing for coinciding judgements ."
Research method	This study presents a taxonomy of video game visual styles constructed from the Research findings/conclusions of a 22-participant cataloging user study of visual styles .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A detailed description of the study , and its value and shortcomings , are presented along with reflections about the challenges of cultivating consensus about visual style in video games ."
Research findings/conclusions	The high degree of overall agreement in the user study demonstrates the potential value of a descriptor like visual style and the use of a cataloging study in developing visual style taxonomies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The resulting visual style taxonomy , the methods and analysis described herein may help improve the organization and retrieval of video games and possibly other visual materials like graphic designs , illustrations , and animations ."
Research method	"Through interviews with 16 Korean immigrants in the United States , we explored their information behaviors in the settlement process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In line with prior work ( Shoham & Strauss , 2008 ) , we found that Korean immigrants needed various types of information : housing , work , banking , transportation , law , school , health , and language ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Out of these information types , the Korean immigrants prioritized information for education and struggled to seek health and legal information ."
Research findings/conclusions	We further uncovered that various information needs are closely intertwined and found an additional type of information need : to build a new social network after migration .
Research questions	They often used Information and Communication Technologies ( ICTs ) as information sources while adapting the ICT infrastructures of the U.S. into their information practices .
Research questions	"ICTs enabled them to build and maintain local and global identity ; however , they may struggle to assess user-generated content in the new context ."
Research findings/conclusions	We noted that their strong use of ICTs for intraethnic interaction might slow down their integration into the host society .
Research questions	We discuss implications for future work to support immigrants ' settlement in the host country .
Research findings/conclusions	This requires cognitive effort that can be demanding .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Building on prior sensemaking models and expanding them with ideas from learning and cognitive psychology , we examined the use of cognitive mechanisms during individual sensemaking ."
Research method	We conducted a qualitative user study of 15 students who searched for and made sense of information for business analysis and news writing tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	"Through the analysis of think-aloud protocols , recordings of screen movements , intermediate work products of sensemaking , including notes and concept maps , and final reports , we observed the use of 17 data-driven and structure-driven mechanisms for processing new information , examining individual concepts and relationships , and detecting anomalies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These cognitive mechanisms , as the basic operators that move sensemaking forward , provide in-depth understanding of how people process information to produce sense ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Meaningful learning and sensemaking are closely related , so our Research findings/conclusions apply to learning as well ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our results contribute to a better understanding of the sensemaking process-how people think-and this better understanding can inform the teaching of thinking skills and the design of improved sensemaking assistants and mind tools .
Research questions	"In a primarily linguistic environment such as cyberspace , words are an expressed form of intent and actions ."
Research questions	We investigate the functions of words and actions in identifying behavioral anomalies of social actors to safeguard the virtual organization .
Research questions	Social actors are likened to sensors as they observe changes in a focal individual 's behavior during computer-mediated communications .
Research questions	"Based on social psychology theories and pragmatic views of words and actions in online communications , we theorize a dyadic attribution model that helps make sense of anomalous behavior in creative online experiments ."
Research method	This model is then tested in an experiment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions show that observation of the behavioral differences between words and actions , based on either external or internal causality , can offer increased ability to detect the compromised trustworthiness of observed individuals-possibly leading to early detection of insider threat potential ."
Research questions	"The dyadic attribution model developed in this sociotechnical study can function to detect behavioral anomalies in cyberspace , and protect the operations of a virtual organization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results demonstrate that the core-scatter distribution of cited authors , institutions , and journals varies for authors in each impact and productivity class ."
Research findings/conclusions	"All authors in the science network receive the majority of their credit from high-impact authors ; however , this effect decreases as authors ' impact levels decrease ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Similarly , the proportion of citations that lower-impact authors make to each other increases as authors ' impact levels decrease ."
Research findings/conclusions	"High-impact authors , who have the highest degree of membership in the science network , publish fewer papers in comparison to highly productive authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , authors with the highest impact make both more references per paper and also more citations to papers in the science network ."
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests that high-impact authors produce the most relevant work in the science network .
Research findings/conclusions	"Comparing practices by productivity level , authors receive the majority of their credit from highly productive authors and authors cite highly productive authors more frequently than less productive authors ."
Research method	"Drawing on a random sample survey in Austin , TX , it borrows the concepts of cultural omnivores and univores to investigate how health information repertoire are related to social capital and digital inequalities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results demonstrate that both the size and the composition of health information repertoires vary by social and digital connectivity .
Research findings/conclusions	People with greater social capital have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on the Internet or interpersonal contacts .
Research findings/conclusions	People with Internet access have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on television .
Research findings/conclusions	"More skilled Internet users are less likely to be univores dependent on interpersonal contacts , whereas frequent Internet users are more likely to be omnivores with a four-channel repertoire including the Internet , interpersonal contacts , television , and newspaper ."
Research findings/conclusions	The positive relationship between social capital and repertoire size is stronger among less-skilled Internet users .
Research findings/conclusions	There are significant variations in health information repertoires in terms of media access and sociodemographic characteristics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Scholarly and practical implications are discussed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although a number of literature reviews have provided overviews of this vast body of research , none has specifically focused on the readers of Wikipedia and issues concerning its readership ."
Research method	"In this systematic literature review , we review 99 studies to synthesize current knowledge regarding the readership of Wikipedia and provide an analysis of research methods employed ."
Research findings/conclusions	The scholarly research has found that Wikipedia is popular not only for lighter topics such as entertainment but also for more serious topics such as health and legal information .
Research questions	"Scholars , librarians , and students are common users , and Wikipedia provides a unique opportunity for educating students in digital literacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude with a summary of key Research findings/conclusions , implications for researchers , and implications for the Wikipedia community ."
Research method	"A network data set is prepared that comprises 27 subjects and their citations aggregated from more than 27,000 journals and proceedings indexed in the Scopus database ."
Research method	"A maximum spanning tree method is employed to extract paths in the weighted , directed , and cyclic networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This paper finds that subjects such as Medicine , Biochemistry , Chemistry , Materials Science , Physics , and Social Sciences are the ones with multiple branches in the spanning tree ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This paper also finds that most paths connect science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ) fields ; 2 critical paths connecting STEM and non-STEM fields are the one from Mathematics to Decision Sciences and the one from Medicine to Social Sciences ."
Research method	"Furthermore , queries are selected by the researchers ."
Research method	"We address these issues by taking a random representative sample of 1,000 informational and 1,000 navigational queries from a major German search engine and comparing Google 's and Bing 's results based on this sample ."
Research method	"Jurors were found through crowdsourcing , and data were collected using specialized software , the Relevance Assessment Tool ( RAT ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that although Google outperforms Bing in both query types , the difference in the performance for informational queries was rather low ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , for navigational queries , Google found the correct answer in 95.3 % of cases , whereas Bing only found the correct answer 76.6 % of the time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that search engine performance on navigational queries is of great importance , because users in this case can clearly identify queries that have returned correct results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"So , performance on this query type may contribute to explaining user satisfaction with search engines ."
Research method	"Using data on 7,700+ articles of Internet studies published in 100+ Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI ) -listed journals in 20002009 , the study adopted a multilevel model to disentangle the impact between article- and journal-level factors on citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	This research strategy resulted in a number of both expected and surprising Research findings/conclusions .
Research findings/conclusions	"The primary determinants for citations are found to be journal-level factors , accounting for 14 % of the variances in citations of Internet studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The impact of some , if not all , article-level factors on citations are moderated by journal-level factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Internet studies , like studies in other areas ( e.g. , management , demography , and ecology ) , are cited more for rhetorical Research questionss , as suggested by the social constructivist approach , rather than as a form of reward , as argued by normative theory ."
Research questions	"The impact of time on citations varies across journals , which creates a growing citation gap for Internet studies published in journals with different characteristics ."
Research method	The 100 journals in this sample included research and practitioner venues across a range of subdomains and specializations .
Research method	"The authors gathered data for 3 points in time , at 10-year intervals during a 20-year period , from 1989-2009 ."
Research method	"They examined the following in detail : journal profiles for publishing characteristics , submission specifications for manuscript parameters , and full-text published manuscripts for compliance with specifications ."
Research method	All were analyzed as point-in-time comparisons as well as trajectories of change over time .
Research findings/conclusions	"Journal profiles demonstrated patterns of increased centralization and digitization , inclusiveness of readership , increased frequency of issues , and increased length of articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Key Research findings/conclusions for manuscript parameter trends included increased specificity of detail , range of manuscript types and research designs accepted , and average manuscript length ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , journals have more explicitly specified elements previously left implicit , such as professional and ethical standards ."
Research method	Criteria for submission procedures and manuscript quality are consistent with university faculty performance standards for productivity and technological advancement .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions carry implications for publishing , journal management , faculty work , and performance evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Access to this literature is crucial for researchers and the general public .
Research findings/conclusions	"Apparently , bibliogifts are available online for free from text-sharing platforms ."
Research questions	"However , little is known about such platforms ."
Research method	What is the size of the underlying digital libraries ?
Research questions	What are the topics covered ?
Research questions	Where do these documents originally come from ?
Research method	This article reports on a study of the Library Genesis platform ( LibGen ) .
Research method	"The 25 million documents ( 42 terabytes ) it hosts and distributes for free are mostly research articles , textbooks , and books in English ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The article collection stems from isolated , but massive , article uploads ( 71 % ) in line with a biblioleaks scenario , as well as from daily crowdsourcing ( 29 % ) by worldwide users of platforms such as Reddit Scholar and Sci-Hub ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By relating the DOIs registered at CrossRef and those cached at LibGen , this study reveals that 36 % of all DOI articles are available for free at LibGen ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This figure is even higher ( 68 % ) for three major publishers : Elsevier , Springer , and Wiley ."
Research findings/conclusions	More research is needed to understand to what extent researchers and the general public have recourse to such text-sharing platforms and why .
Research method	"We collected Twitter data over 51 days , related to the first 30 Italian organizations in the 2015 ranking of Forbes Global 2000out of which we selected the five with the most relevant volumes of tweets ."
Research method	"We analyzed the communication of the company leaders , together with the dialogue among the stakeholders of each company , to understand the association with perceived leadership styles and dimensions ."
Research method	"To assess leadership profiles , we referred to the 10-factor model developed by Barchiesi and La Bella in 2007 ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We maintain the distinctiveness of the approach we propose , as it allows a rapid assessment of the perceived leadership capabilities of an enterprise , as they emerge from its social media interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It can also be used to show how companies respond and manage their communication when specific events take place , and to assess their stakeholder 's reactions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study serves to fill this gap by using a large longitudinal dataset to examine these differences .
Research method	"Using CiteScore as a proxy for journal scientific impact , we employ a series of statistical tests to identify the quartile categories and disciplinary areas in which impact trends differ notably between closed-and open-access journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that closed-access journals have a noticeable advantage in social sciences ( for example , business and economics ) , whereas open-access journals perform well in medical and healthcare domains ( for example , health profession and nursing ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we find that after controlling for a journal 's rank and disciplinary differences , there are statistically more closed-access journals in the top 10 % , Quartile 1 , and Quartile 2 categories asmeasured by CiteScore ; in contrast , more open-access journals in Quartile 4 gained scientific impact from 2011 to 2015 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Considering dynamic and disciplinary trends in tandem , we find that more closed-access journals in Social Sciences gained in impact , whereas in biochemistry and medicine , more open-access journals experienced such gains ."
Research questions	"Traditional methods of community detection usually assume that the network 's structural information is fully known , which is not the case in many practical networks ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , most previous community detection algorithms do not differentiate multiple relationships between objects or persons in the real world ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a new approach that utilizes social interaction data ( e.g. , users ' posts on Facebook ) to address the community detection problem in Facebook and to find the multiple social groups of a Facebook user ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Some advantages to our approach are ( a ) it does not depend on structural information , ( b ) it differentiates the various relationships that exist among friends , and ( c ) it can discover a target user 's multiple communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the experiment , we detect the community distribution of Facebook users using the proposed method ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experiment shows that our method can achieve the result of having the average scores of Total-Community-Purity and Total-Cluster-Purity both at approximately 0.8 .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This networked nature has been relatively less explored in the literature on altmetrics , although new network-level approaches are starting to appear ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A general conceptualization of the role of social media networks in science communication , and particularly of social media as a specific type of interface between science and society , is still missing ."
Research questions	"The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for appraising interactions between science and society in multiple directions , in what we call heterogeneous couplings ."
Research method	"Heterogeneous couplings are conceptualized as the co-occurrence of science and non-science objects , actors , and interactions in online media environments ."
Research findings/conclusions	This conceptualization provides a common framework to study the interactions between science and non-science actors as captured via online and social media platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	"The conceptualization of heterogeneous couplings opens wider opportunities for the development of network applications and analyses of the interactions between societal and scholarly entities in social media environments , paving the way toward more advanced forms of altmetrics , social ( media ) studies of science , and the conceptualization and operationalization of more advanced science-society studies ."
Research method	"Combining data from the entirety of arXiv and the Web of Science ( WoS ) , this article investigates ( a ) the proportion of papers across all disciplines that are on arXiv and the proportion of arXiv papers that are in the WoS , ( b ) the elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication , and ( c ) the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arXiv e-prints and their published version ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics , and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository ."
Research findings/conclusions	Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics .
Research findings/conclusions	"In physics , mathematics , as well as in astronomy and astrophysics , arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The arXiv versions of papers-both published and unpublished-have lower citation rates than published papers , although there is almost no difference in the impact of the arXiv versions of published and unpublished papers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Its meaning has been stretched to apply to experiences ranging from the mundane to the exceptional .
Research findings/conclusions	"Serendipity , however , is consistently associated with unexpected and positive personal , scholarly , scientific , organizational , and societal events and discoveries ."
Research questions	"Diverse serendipitous experiences share a conceptual space ; therefore , what lessons can we draw from an exploration of how serendipity unfolds and what may influence it ?"
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article describes an investigation of work-related serendipity .
Research method	Twelve professionals and academics from a variety of fields were interviewed .
Research method	The core of the semi-structured interviews focused on participants ' own work-related experiences that could be recalled and discussed in depth .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research validated and augmented prior research while consolidating previous models of serendipity into a single model of the process of serendipity , consisting of : Trigger , Connection , Follow-up , and Valuable Outcome , and an Unexpected Thread that runs through 1 or more of the first 4 elements ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Together , the elements influence the Perception of Serendipity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , this research identified what factors relating to the individual and their environment may facilitate the main elements of serendipity and further influence its perception ."
Research method	"( 10.1002/asi.24460 ) , in which the disappearance of 176 open access journals from the Internet is noted ."
Research findings/conclusions	One reason these journals may have vanished is that they were predatory journals : a possibility the original paper did not consider .
Research findings/conclusions	The delisting of predators from the Directory of Open Access Journals in 2014 and the abundance of predatory journals and awareness thereof in North America parsimoniously explain the temporal and geographic patterns Laakso et al .
Research findings/conclusions	observed .
Research findings/conclusions	The major challenges for question retrieval in cQA are related to solving the lexical gap problem and estimating the relevance between questions .
Research method	"In this study , we first solve the lexical gap problem using a translation-based language model ( TRLM ) ."
Research method	"Thereafter , we determine features and methods that are competent for estimating the relevance between two questions ."
Research questions	"For this Research questions , we explore ways to use the results of a dependency parser and question classification for category information ."
Research method	"Head-dependent pairs are first extracted as bigram features , called dependency bigrams , from the analysis results of the dependency parser ."
Research method	The probability of each category is estimated using the softmax approach based on the scores of the classification results .
Research method	"Subsequently , we propose two retrieval models-the dependency-based model ( DM ) and category-based model ( CM ) -and they are applied to the previous model , TRLM ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve the performance of question retrieval in cQA services .
Research findings/conclusions	Most sentiment analysis strategies fall into 2 categories : lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	"While the latter often requires sentiment-labeled data to build a machine learning model , both approaches need sentiment-labeled data for evaluation ."
Research questions	"Unfortunately , most data domains lack sufficient quantities of labeled data , especially at the subdocument level ."
Research questions	"Semisupervised learning ( SSL ) , a machine learning technique that requires only a few labeled examples and can automatically label unlabeled data , is a promising strategy to deal with the issue of insufficient labeled data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although previous studies have shown promising results of applying various SSL algorithms to solve a sentiment-analysis problem , co-training , an SSL algorithm , has not attracted much attention for sentiment analysis largely due to its restricted assumptions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Therefore , this study focuses on revisiting co-training in depth and discusses several co-training strategies for sentiment analysis following a loose assumption ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results suggest that co-training can be more effective than can other currently adopted SSL methods for sentiment analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	Download counts tend to be 2 orders of magnitude higher and less skewedly distributed than citations .
Research findings/conclusions	A mathematical model based on the sum of two exponentials does not adequately capture monthly download counts .
Research findings/conclusions	"The degree of correlation at the article level within a journal is similar to that at the journal level in the discipline covered by that journal , suggesting that the differences between journals are , to a large extent , discipline specific ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the fact that in all studied journals download and citation counts per article positively correlate , little overlap may exist between the set of articles appearing in the top of the citation distribution and that with the most frequently downloaded ones ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Usage and citation leaks , bulk downloading , differences between reader and author populations in a subject field , the type of document or its content , differences in obsolescence patterns between downloads and citations , and different functions of reading and citing in the research process all provide possible explanations of differences between download and citation distributions ."
Research method	We used latent class analysis to categorize institutions based on their publications in certain subject areas .
Research findings/conclusions	"Even though this categorization does not relate directly to scientific performance , our results show that it exercises an important influence on the outcome of a performance measurement : Certain subject area types of institutions have an advantage in the ranking positions when compared with others ."
Research findings/conclusions	This advantage manifests itself not only when performance is measured with an indicator that is not field-normalized but also for indicators that are field-normalized .
Research questions	Previous studies have created various bibliographic indicators for the identification of emerging research topics .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , as indicated by Rotolo et al ."
Research findings/conclusions	"( Research Policy 44 , 1827-1843 , ) , the most serious problems are the lack of an acknowledged definition of emergence and incomplete elaboration of the linkages between the definitions that are used and the indicators that are created ."
Research method	"With these issues in mind , this study first adjusts the definition of an emerging technology that Rotolo et al ."
Research findings/conclusions	( 2015 ) have proposed to accommodate the analysis .
Research method	"Next , a set of criteria for the identification of emerging topics is proposed according to the adjusted definition and attributes of emergence ."
Research method	"Using two sets of parameter values , several emerging research topics are identified ."
Research method	"Finally , evaluation tests are conducted by demonstration of the proposed approach and comparison with previous studies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The strength of the present methodology lies in the fact that it is fully transparent , straightforward , and flexible ."
Research questions	This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Issues covered include : use of and intentions regarding OAP , and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP , journal article publication services , peer review , and reuse ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite reporting engagement in OAP , academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Broadly , academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP , and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As regards services , rigorous peer review , followed by rapid publication were most valued ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work ; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse , but not in favor of commercial reuse , adaptations , and inclusion in anthologies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Comparing science , technology , and medicine with arts , humanities , and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions , but , in general , the effect size was small , suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community ."
Research method	"Also the concave or convex relation between the proportion of top 100 theta % publications , for different fractions theta , is explained using the obtained new informetric model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , only a limited number of studies have showed the relationship between cognitive styles and web search behavior ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most importantly , it is not clear which components of web search behavior are influenced by cognitive styles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article examines the relationships between users ' cognitive styles and their web searching and develops a model that portrays the relationship .
Research method	The study uses qualitative and quantitative analyses based on data gathered from 50 participants .
Research method	"A questionnaire was utilized to collect participants ' demographic information , and Riding 's ( 1991 ) Cognitive Styles Analysis ( CSA ) test to assess their cognitive styles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that users ' cognitive styles influenced their information-searching strategies , query reformulation behavior , web navigational styles , and information-processing approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	The user model developed in this study depicts the fundamental relationships between users ' web search behavior and their cognitive styles .
Research findings/conclusions	Modeling web search behavior with a greater understanding of users ' cognitive styles can help information science researchers and information systems designers to bridge the semantic gap between the user and the systems .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Implications of the research for theory and practice , and future work , are discussed ."
Research questions	Key to the success of this digital medium is its ability to support information exchange when compared with face-to-face communication .
Research questions	"Its potential is highlighted by the literature illustrating the inadequacy of traditional computer-mediated communication ( CMC ) tools , such as e-mail and video conferencing , to support communication among geographically dispersed coworkers ."
Research questions	Many of the traditional CMC tools lack the needed support for effective information exchange to varying degrees .
Research questions	"The emergence of a sophisticated virtual world , such as Second Life , has met this dearth ."
Research questions	We draw on the theories of task closure and media richness to propose a parsimonious model of information exchange behavior in a virtual world context .
Research findings/conclusions	"Observations from a series of group-based project discussion sessions in face-to-face and virtual world settings , respectively , suggest that the information exchange between coworkers in both settings could be similar ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , virtual coworkers might be able to achieve task closure ( i.e. , the complete transmission of intended work-related information ) in the same way as their counterparts in the face-to-face context ."
Research questions	Their main focus is to discover and display new knowledge in large document databases .
Research questions	"They have broad and innovative fields of application for strategic scouting in science and technology , knowledge management , business intelligence , and scientific and technological evaluation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents a new method for mapping the strategic research network and illustrates its application to the strategic analysis of the knowledge domain Spanish Research in Protected Areas for the Period 1981-2005 .
Research method	This strategic knowledge is displayed through a set of two-dimensional cartographic maps and three-dimensional images of two networks : the international network WoS_KWAJ ( 1981-2005 ) and the national network IEDCYT_KWAJ ( 1981-2005 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	These maps can be very useful in decision-making processes for science and technology policy .
Research method	This is achieved through an identification of the antecedents and effects of experiences that contribute to negative emotions or to a reduction in interest in using social networks with the help of a mixed-methods study .
Research findings/conclusions	Five generic antecedents and varying effects of these antecedents on individual user activities have been identified .
Research findings/conclusions	"Fatigue experiences could result from social dynamics or social interactions of the members of the community , content made available on social networks , unwanted changes to the platform that hosts the network , self-detected immersive tendencies of the users themselves , or a natural maturing of the life cycle of the community to which the user belongs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The intensity of the fatigue experience varies along a continuum ranging from a mild or transient experience to a more severe experience , which may eventually result in the user 's decision to quit the environment that causes stress ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , users were found to take short rest breaks from the environment , moderate their activities downward , or suspend their social network activities altogether as a result of fatigue experiences ."
Research questions	"From user-generated content to crowdsourcing to peer production to fan fiction to citizen science , the concept remains both unexamined and heterogeneous in its definition ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Intuitions about participation are confirmed by some examples , but scandalized by others , and it is difficult to pinpoint why participation seems to be robust in some cases and partial in others ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper we offer an empirically based , comparative analysis of participation that demonstrates its multidimensionality and provides a framework that allows clear distinctions and better analyses of the role of participation ."
Research method	We derive 7 dimensions of participations from the literature on participation and exemplify those dimensions using a set of 102 cases of contemporary participation that include uses of the Internet and new media .
Research questions	For many search sessions it is essential to achieving the task goal .
Research method	This work investigates text relevance decision dynamics in a question-answering task by direct measurement of eye movement using eye-tracking and brain activity using electroencephalography EEG .
Research findings/conclusions	The EEG measurements are correlated with the user 's goal-directed attention allocation revealed by their eye movements .
Research method	"In a within-subject lab experiment ( N=24 ) , participants read short news stories of varied relevance ."
Research method	"Eye movement and EEG features were calculated in three epochs of reading each news story ( early , middle , final ) and for periods where relevant words were read ."
Research method	Perceived relevance classification models were learned for each epoch .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show reading epochs where relevant words were processed could be distinguished from other epochs .
Research findings/conclusions	The classification models show increasing divergence in processing relevant vs. irrelevant documents after the initial epoch .
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests differences in cognitive processes used to assess texts of varied relevance levels and provides evidence for the potential to detect these differences in information search sessions using eye tracking and EEG .
Research questions	The fundamental assumption in group assignments is that students ' collaboration substantially enhances their learning .
Research method	The present study focused on the group work strategies adopted by upper secondary school students in source-based writing assignments .
Research method	Seventeen groups authored Wikipedia or Wikipedia-style articles and were interviewed during and after the assignment .
Research method	"Group work strategies were analyzed in 6 activities : planning , searching , assessing sources , reading , writing , and editing ."
Research method	"The students used 2 cooperative strategies : delegation and division of work , and 2 collaborative strategies : pair and group collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	Division of work into independently conducted parts was the most popular group work strategy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Also group collaboration , where students worked together to complete an activity , was commonly applied ."
Research method	Division of work was justified by efficiency in completing the project and by ease of control in the fair division of contributions .
Research method	The motivation behind collaboration was related to quality issues and shared responsibility .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We suggest that the present designs of learning tasks lead students to avoid collaboration , increasing the risk of low learning outcomes in information literacy instruction ."
Research questions	Can citation patterns of highly-cited papers be distinguished in an early phase as fast-breaking papers ?
Research questions	Can late bloomers or sleeping beauties be identified ?
Research findings/conclusions	"Most interesting , we find differences between sticky knowledge claims that continue to be cited more than 10 years after publication and transient knowledge claims that show a decay pattern after reaching a peak within a few years ."
Research findings/conclusions	Only papers following the trajectory of a sticky knowledge claim can be expected to have a sustained impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions raise questions about indicators of excellence that use aggregated citation rates after 2 or 3 years ( e. g. , impact factors ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Because aggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns , fifth-order polynomials ( with four bending points ) are needed to capture citation curves precisely ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the journals under study , the most frequently cited groups were furthermore much smaller than 10 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although GBTM has proved a useful method for investigating differences among citation trajectories , the methodology does not allow us to define a percentage of highly cited papers inductively across different fields and journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using multinomial logistic regression , we conclude that predictor variables such as journal names , number of authors , etc. , do not affect the stickiness of knowledge claims in terms of citations but only the levels of aggregated citations ( which are field-specific ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Social impact of papers can be defined as the net effect of citations on a network .
Research findings/conclusions	"A publication exerts direct and indirect influence on others ( e.g. , by citing articles ) and is itself influenced directly and indirectly ( e.g. , by cited articles ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This network leads to an influence structure of citing and cited publications .
Research method	"Drawing on cooperative game theory , our research problem is to translate into mathematical equations the rules that govern the social impact of a paper in a citation network ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we show that when citation relationships between academic papers function within a citation structure , the result is social impact instead of the ( individual ) citation impact of each paper ."
Research method	Mathematical equations explain the interaction between papers in such a citation structure .
Research findings/conclusions	"The equations show that the social impact of a paper is affected by the ( individual ) citation impact of citing publications , immediacy of citing articles , and number of both citing and cited papers ."
Research method	Examples are provided for several academic papers .
Research questions	Publication fees or article-processing charges ( APC ) s have become the predominant means for funding professional OA publishing .
Research method	"We surveyed 1,038 authors who recently published articles in 74 OA journals that charge APCs stratified into seven discipline categories ."
Research method	"Authors were asked about the source of funding for the APC , factors influencing their choice of a journal and past history publishing in OA and subscription journals ."
Research method	Additional information about the journal and the authors ' country were obtained from the journal website .
Research method	A total of 429 ( 41 % ) authors from 69 journals completed the survey .
Research findings/conclusions	There were large differences in the source of funding among disciplines .
Research findings/conclusions	Journals with impact factors charged higher APCs as did journals from disciplines where grant funding is plentiful .
Research findings/conclusions	"Fit , quality , and speed of publication were the most important factors in the authors ' choice of a journal ."
Research findings/conclusions	OA was less important but a significant factor for many authors in their choice of a journal to publish .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions are consistent with other research on OA publishing and suggest that OA publishing funded through APCs is likely to continue to grow .
Research questions	Reusing text without crediting the original authors is considered plagiarism .
Research questions	A number of studies have reported the prevalence of plagiarism in academia .
Research questions	"As a consequence , numerous institutions and researchers are dedicated to devising systems to automate the process of checking for plagiarism ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work focuses on the problem of detecting text reuse in scientific papers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The contributions of this paper are twofold : ( a ) we survey the existing approaches for plagiarism detection based on content , based on content and structure , and based on citations and references ; and ( b ) we compare content and citation-based approaches with the goal of evaluating whether they are complementary and if their combination can improve the quality of the detection ."
Research findings/conclusions	We carry out experiments with real data sets of scientific papers and concluded that a combination of the methods can be beneficial .
Research questions	"Finding credible health information from a plethora of information on the web may be more challenging for older adults , who have relatively less experience with the Internet ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article reports on the Research findings/conclusions of an exploratory study of older adults & apos ; credibility assessments of online health information .
Research method	"The data collected through semistructured interviews with 21 older adult Internet users in the United States were analyzed based on the extended typology of web credibility ( Choi & Stvilia , 2015 , Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology , 66 , 2399-2414 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions of the study revealed that older adults paid closer attention to operator-related credibility cues and heuristics when judging the credibility of health information on the web , followed by content- and design-related ones ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , the Research findings/conclusions suggest that participants who were younger and used the Internet more frequently employed a wider variety of cues and heuristics to evaluate the credibility of online health information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these Research findings/conclusions , both theoretical and practical implications of the research and future research directions are discussed ."
Research questions	"Negation is usually considered as a polarity shifter , whereas intensifiers are regarded as amplifiers or diminishers of the strength of such polarity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Modality , in turn , has only been addressed in a very naive fashion , so that modal forms are treated as polarity blockers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , processing these constructions as mere polarity modifiers may be adequate for polarity classification , but it is not enough for more complex tasks ( e.g. , intensity classification ) , for which a more fine-grained model based on emotions is needed ."
Research questions	"In this work , we study the effect of modifiers on the emotions affected by them and propose a model of negation , intensifiers , and modality especially conceived for sentiment analysis tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	We compare our emotion-based strategy with two traditional approaches based on polar expressions and find that representing the text as a set of emotions increases accuracy in different classification tasks and that this representation allows for a more accurate modeling of modifiers that results in further classification improvements .
Research questions	We also study the most common uses of modifiers in opinionated texts and quantify their impact in polarity and intensity classification .
Research questions	"Finally , we analyze the joint effect of emotional modifiers and find that interesting synergies exist between them ."
Research method	"This study analyses Web information search behavior , and applies the multiple demand theory to propose two models to help a visitor allocate time for multiple links ."
Research method	The process of searching is viewed as a formal choice problem in which the visitor attempts to choose from multiple Web links to maximize the total utility .
Research method	The proposed models are calibrated to clickstream data collected from an educational institute over a seven-and-a-half month period .
Research method	"Based on the best fit model , a metric , utility loss , is constructed to measure the performance of each link and arrange them accordingly ."
Research findings/conclusions	Empirical results show that the proposed metric is highly efficient for prioritizing the links on a homepage and the methodology can also be used to study the feasibility of introducing a new function in a Website .
Research method	Methods used include cognitive task analysis and facet analysis to better understand the information-seeking and information-use practices of people working with folktales and the intellectual dimensions of the domain .
Research method	"Interviews were conducted with 9 informants , representing scholars , storytellers , and teachers who rely on folktales in their professional lives to determine common tasks across user groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Four tasks were identified : collect , create , instruct , and study ."
Research method	"Facet analysis was conducted on the transcripts of these interviews , and a representative set of literature that included subject indexing material and a random stratified set of document surrogates drawn from a collection of folktales , including bibliographic records , introductions , reviews , tables of contents , and bibliographies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Eight facets were identified as most salient for this group of users : agent , association , context , documentation , location , subject , time , and viewpoint ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Implications include the need for systems designers to devise methods for harvesting and integrating extant contextual material into search and discovery systems , and to take into account user-desired features in the development of enhanced services for digital repositories ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research examined the dynamic processes of relationship formation , maintenance , and demise in a massively multiplayer online game ."
Research questions	"Drawing from evolutionary and ecological theories of social networks , this study focuses on the impact of three sets of evolutionary factors in the context of social relationships in the online game EverQuest II ( EQII ) : the aging and maturation processes , social architecture of the game , and homophily and proximity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A longitudinal analysis of tie persistence and decay demonstrated the transient nature of social relationships in EQII , but ties became considerably more durable over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , character level similarity , shared guild membership , and geographic proximity were powerful mechanisms in preserving social relationships ."
Research findings/conclusions	Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics ."
Research questions	Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely .
Research questions	"Moreover , research data take many forms , are handled in many ways , using many approaches , and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context ."
Research questions	Data sharing is thus a conundrum .
Research method	"Four rationales for sharing data are examined , drawing examples from the sciences , social sciences , and humanities : ( 1 ) to reproduce or to verify research , ( 2 ) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public , ( 3 ) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data , and ( 4 ) to advance the state of research and innovation ."
Research questions	"These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing , by beneficiaries , and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The challenges are to understand which data might be shared , by whom , with whom , under what conditions , why , and to what effects ."
Research findings/conclusions	Answers will inform data policy and practice .
Research method	We conducted a survey of 307 reviewers of submissions to the International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ( CHI 2011 ) to gain a better understanding of their motivations for reviewing .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that encouraging high-quality research , giving back to the research community , and finding out about new research were the top general motivations for reviewing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We further found that relevance of the submission to a reviewer 's research and relevance to the reviewer 's expertise were the strongest motivations for accepting a request to review , closely followed by a number of social factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Gender and reviewing experience significantly affected some reviewing motivations , such as the desire for learning and preparing for higher reviewing roles ."
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss implications of our Research findings/conclusions for the design of future peer review processes and systems to support them .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the data protection lens is too narrow to analyze personalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To define conditions for personalization , we should understand data protection in its larger fundamental rights context , starting with the closely connected right to privacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If the right to privacy is considered along with other European fundamental rights that protect information and communication flows , namely , communications confidentiality ; the right to receive information ; and freedom of expression , opinion , and thought , these rights are observed to enable what I call a personal information sphere for each person ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This notion highlights how privacy interferences affect other fundamental rights .
Research findings/conclusions	The personal information sphere is grounded in European case law and is thus not just an academic affair .
Research questions	"The essence of the personal information sphere is control , yet with a different meaning than mere control as guaranteed by data protection law ."
Research questions	The personal information sphere is about people controlling how they situate themselves in information and communication networks .
Research findings/conclusions	"It follows that , to respect privacy and related rights , online personalization providers should actively involve users in the personalization process and enable them to use personalization for personal goals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Current online tools and visualization prototypes show small , localized subsets and do not provide the ability to explore the predominant patterns of the overall subject structure ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study describes subject tree modifications that facilitate browsing for documents by capitalizing on the highly uneven distribution of real-world collections .
Research method	The approach is demonstrated on two large collections organized by the Library of Congress Subject Headings ( LCSH ) and Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that the LCSH subject tree can be reduced to 49 % of its initial complexity while maintaining access to 83 % of the collection , and the MeSH tree can be reduced to 45 % of its initial complexity while maintaining access to 97 % of the collection ."
Research findings/conclusions	A simple solution to negate the loss of access is discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	The visual impact is demonstrated by using traditional outline views and a slider control allowing searchers to change the subject structure dynamically according to their needs .
Research findings/conclusions	This study has implications for the development of information organization theory and human-information interaction techniques for subject trees .
Research method	The algorithm groups web results according to the individuals they refer to .
Research findings/conclusions	The best state-of-the-art approaches require training data in order to learn thresholds for deciding when to group the webpages .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the ambiguity level of person names on the web could not be previously estimated and the results of those methods strongly depend on the thresholds obtained with the training collections ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We present the concept of adaptive threshold , which avoids the need of a previous supervised learning process , depending only on the content of the compared documents to decide if they refer to the same person ."
Research method	"We evaluated our approach using three datasets reaching close results to those obtained by the most successful algorithms in the state-of-the-art that require such a learning process , and outperforming the results of those obtained by algorithms that do not require it ."
Research questions	"How well do or can these measures measure or predict the past , current , or future scholarly performance of an individual ?"
Research method	"Using data from the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System we analyze the publication , citation , download , and distinction histories of a cohort of 922 individuals who received a U.S. PhD in astronomy in the period 1972-1976 ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	By examining the same and different measures at the same and different times for the same individuals we are able to show the capabilities and limitations of each measure .
Research findings/conclusions	"Because the distributions are lognormal , measurement uncertainties are multiplicative ; we show that in order to state with 95 % confidence that one person 's citations and downloads are significantly higher than another person 's , the log difference in the ratio of counts must be at least 0.3dex , which corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 2 ."
Research questions	"This study analyzes ( a ) whether search expertise , prior topic knowledge , topic interest , or flow experience during a search of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) influence success in finding relevant information and ( b ) whether the effects of these predictors vary during the course of the search process ."
Research method	"Two different search tasks are investigated : The evaluating task focuses on the selection of relevant websites from a large number of potentially relevant sites , whereas the finding task focuses on the difficulty of finding information in the case of a lack of potentially relevant websites ."
Research method	Survival analysis is applied to data from a quasi-experiment .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This analysis considers not only the question of whether information is found , but also when ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions show that search expertise and flow explain success in the evaluation task ; however , flow is only influential in the first phase of the search process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the finding task , the predictors have no explanatory strength ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Simulation results show that the rate of forgetting has a significantly negative effect on stakeholders ' perceptions and the incremental increase in the number of affected individuals has a positive effect on the maximum level of stakeholders ' perceptions , but negative effect on the duration of stakeholders ' perceptions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , a delay effect , a stagnation effect , and a cumulative effect exist in the evolution of stakeholders ' perceptions ."
Research findings/conclusions	There is a spike at the beginning of the profile of stakeholders ' perceptions in the Damped Exponential Model .
Research findings/conclusions	An empirical test supports the validity of this model of stakeholders ' disaster perceptions .
Research findings/conclusions	The overlays indicate both the quantity and the quality of patents at the city level .
Research findings/conclusions	"This information is relevant for research questions in technology analysis , innovation studies , and evolutionary economics , as well as economic geography ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The resulting maps can also be relevant for technological innovation policies and research and development management , because the U.S. market can be considered the leading market for patenting and patent competition ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition to the maps , the routines provide quantitative data about the patents for statistical analysis ."
Research method	The cities on the map are colored according to the results of significance tests .
Research method	The overlays are explored for the Netherlands as a national system of innovations and further elaborated in two cases of emerging technologies : ribonucleic acid interference ( RNAi ) and nanotechnology .
Research questions	Self-perception theory posits that individuals come to know their own internal beliefs by inferring them partially from observations of their own overt behavior .
Research method	"Building on self-perception theory and adhering to the principle that the relationship between behavior and beliefs is one of mutual influence , we develop a research model to explore the behavioral transfer from knowledge seeking to knowledge contributing and consider the mediating effect of intrinsic motivation ."
Research method	Data collected from 430 users of Web 2.0 applications were used to test the model .
Research findings/conclusions	The mediating role of intrinsic motivation between knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing is confirmed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These Research findings/conclusions and their implications for theory and practice are discussed .
Research questions	"Here , we investigate a means for influencing the performance of citizen scientists toward enhancing overall participation ."
Research method	"Building on past social comparison research , we pair citizen scientists with a software-based virtual peer in an environmental monitoring project ."
Research method	"Through a series of experiments in which virtual peers outperform , underperform , or perform similarly to human participants , we investigate the influence of their presence on citizen science participation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To offer insight into the psychological determinants to the response to this intervention , we propose a new dynamic model describing the bidirectional interaction between humans and virtual peers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results demonstrate that participant contribution can be enhanced through the presence of a virtual peer , creating a feedback loop where participants tend to increase or decrease their contribution in response to their peers ' performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By including virtual peers that systematically outperform the participants , we demonstrate a fourfold increase in their contribution to the citizen science project ."
Research questions	This article conceptualizes personally meaningful activities as a site for information behavior research .
Research questions	Personal meaning is discussed as a necessity for human beings .
Research questions	"In the information age , there is an ethical directive for developers of information technology to promote and afford personally meaningful activities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article builds on discussions of the pleasurable and profound in information science conceptually and empirically .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , it argues for the necessity of phenomenology in these discussions , which heretofore has been mostly absent ."
Research method	"Next , it presents results from a qualitative , empirical study on information in personally meaningful activities ."
Research method	"The empirical study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine information experience in three domains of personal meaning : Bible reading , ultramarathon running , and art-making ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The following themes emerge and are discussed : identity , central practice , curiosity , and presence ."
Research findings/conclusions	Opportunities for technological development and further research are outlined .
Research questions	The migration of a database for preservation Research questionss poses several challenges .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , our Research findings/conclusions show that relevant issues are file-format heterogeneity , collection volume , time and database structure evolution , and deviation from the governing standard ."
Research questions	"This article presents and discusses how such issues interfere with an organization 's ability to undertake a migration , for preservation Research questionss , of records from a relational database ."
Research method	The case study at hand concerns six Norwegian municipality record-keeping databases covering a period from 1999 to 2012 .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions are presented with a discussion on how these issues manifest themselves as a problem for long-term preservation .
Research findings/conclusions	The results discussed here may help an organization and Information Systems ( IS ) manager to establish a best practice when undertaking a migration project and enable them to avoid some of the pitfalls that were discovered during this project .
Research questions	"However , because global citation databases seem to offer weak coverage of books outside the West , it is not clear whether the influence of non-Western books can be assessed with citations ."
Research method	"To investigate this , citations were extracted from Google Books and Google Scholar to 1,357 arts , humanities and social sciences ( AHSS ) books published by 5 university presses during 19612012 in 1 non-Western nation , Malaysia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A significant minority of the books ( 23 % in Google Books and 37 % in Google Scholar , 45 % in total ) had been cited , with a higher proportion cited if they were older or in English ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The combination of Google Books and Google Scholar is therefore recommended , with some provisos , for non-Western countries seeking to differentiate between books with some impact and books with no impact , to identify the highly-cited works or to develop an indicator of academic publisher prestige ."
Research questions	"As artifacts , ontologies can have diverse applications in knowledge management , information retrieval , and information systems , to mention a few ."
Research questions	They have been largely applied to organize information in complex fields like Biomedicine .
Research questions	"In this article , we present the OntoNeo Ontology , an initiative to build a formal ontology in the obstetrics and neonatal domain ."
Research questions	OntoNeo is a resource that has been designed to serve as a comprehensive infrastructure providing scientific research and healthcare professionals with access to relevant information .
Research questions	"The goal of OntoNeo is twofold : ( a ) to organize specialized medical knowledge , and ( b ) to provide a potential consensual representation of the medical information found in electronic health records and medical information systems ."
Research method	"To describe our initiative , we first provide background information about distinct theories underlying ontology , top-level computational ontologies and their applications in Biomedicine ."
Research method	"Then , we present the methodology employed in the development of OntoNeo and the results obtained to date ."
Research questions	"Finally , we discuss the applicability of OntoNeo by presenting a proof of concept that illustrates its potential usefulness in the realm of healthcare information systems ."
Research questions	Several techniques have been proposed but maintaining consistent accuracy levels over all data sets is still a major challenge .
Research findings/conclusions	We identify two major issues associated with the AND problem .
Research questions	"First , the namesake problem in which two or more authors with the same name publishes in a similar domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , the diverse topic problem in which one author publishes in diverse topical domains with a different set of coauthors ."
Research questions	"In this work , we initially propose a method named ATGEP for AND that addresses the namesake issue ."
Research method	We evaluate the performance of ATGEP using various ambiguous name references collected from the Arnetminer Citation ( AC ) and Web of Science ( WoS ) data set .
Research findings/conclusions	We empirically show that the two aforementioned problems are crucial to address the AND problem that are difficult to handle using state-of-the-art techniques .
Research method	"To handle the diverse topic issue , we extend ATGEP to a new variant named ATGEP-web that considers external web information of the authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments show that with enough information available from external web sources ATGEP-web can significantly improve the results further compared with ATGEP .
Research questions	"The aim of this study is to develop an integrative understanding of the impact of two diffusion channels ( i.e. , broadcasting vs. virality ) on innovation adoption ."
Research method	"Using citations of a series of classic algorithms and the time series of co-authorship as the footprints of their diffusion trajectories , we propose a novel method to analyze the intertwining relationships between broadcasting and virality in the innovation diffusion process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions show that broadcasting and virality have similar diffusion power , but play different roles across diffusion stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Broadcasting is more powerful in the early stages but may be gradually caught up or even surpassed by virality in the later period .
Research findings/conclusions	"Meanwhile , diffusion speed in virality is significantly faster than broadcasting and members from virality channels tend to adopt the same innovation repetitively ."
Research method	A model of these motivations was developed based on two existing motivation models : motivation for self-archiving in academia and motivations for information sharing in social media .
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed model is composed of 18 factors drawn from personal , social , professional , and external contexts , including enjoyment , personal/professional gain , reputation , learning , self-efficacy , altruism , reciprocity , trust , community interest , social engagement , publicity , accessibility , self-archiving culture , influence of external actors , credibility , system stability , copyright concerns , additional time , and effort ."
Research method	Two hundred and twenty-six ResearchGate users participated in the survey .
Research findings/conclusions	"Accessibility was the most highly rated factor , followed by altruism , reciprocity , trust , self-efficacy , reputation , publicity , and others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Personal , social , and professional factors were also highly rated , while external factors were rated relatively low ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Motivations were correlated with one another , demonstrating that RG motivations for self-archiving could increase or decrease based on several factors in combination with motivations from the personal , social , professional , and external contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We believe the Research findings/conclusions from this study can increase our understanding of users ' motivations in sharing their research and provide useful implications for the development and improvement of ASNS services , thereby attracting more active users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the most widespread applications are difficult to use for people with disabilities , or may involve some risks if no previous training has been undertaken ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work describes a novel social network for cognitively disabled people along with a clustering-based method for modeling activity and socialization processes of its users in a noninvasive way .
Research method	"This closed social network is specifically designed for people with cognitive disabilities , called Guremintza , that provides the network administrators ( e.g. , social workers ) with two types of reports : summary statistics of the network usage and behavior patterns discovered by a data mining process ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments made in an initial stage of the network show that the discovered patterns are meaningful to the social workers and they find them useful in monitoring the progress of the users .
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , citation counts may accrue too slowly for use in some formal and informal evaluations ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is therefore important to investigate whether alternative metrics could be used as substitutes .
Research method	"This article assesses whether one such altmetric , Mendeley readership counts , correlates strongly with citation counts across all medical fields , whether the relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded , and whether they are distributed similarly to citation counts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on a sample of 332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in Scopus , citation counts correlated strongly ( about 0.7 ; 78 % of articles had at least one reader ) with Mendeley readership counts ( from the new version 1 applications programming interface [ API ] ) in almost all fields , with one minor exception , and the correlations tended to decrease slightly when student readers were excluded ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Readership followed either a lognormal or a hooked power law distribution , whereas citations always followed a hooked power law , showing that the two may have underlying differences ."
Research questions	"These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields , both bound to coordinates , as two general paradigms of geographic representation ."
Research questions	The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems .
Research findings/conclusions	"This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human-computer interaction , but also for location-based services ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although this shortcoming has been observed before , we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view , based on a set of core concepts of spatial information ."
Research questions	These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human-machine spatial question asking and answering .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems .
Research findings/conclusions	"The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information , when these are adequately exploited and combined ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this work we suggest an option for exploring networks , called the h-strength , with explicit focus on links and their strengths ."
Research findings/conclusions	The h-strength and its extensions can naturally simplify a complex network to a small and concise subnetwork ( h-subnet ) but retains the most important links with its core structure .
Research findings/conclusions	"Its applications in 2 typical information networks , the paper cocitation network of a topic ( the h-index ) and 5 scientific collaboration networks in the field of water resources , suggest that h-strength and its extensions could be a useful choice for abstracting , simplifying , and visualizing a complex network ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we observe that the 2 informetric models , the Glanzel-Schubert model and the Hirsch model , roughly hold in the context of the h-strength for the collaboration networks ."
Research questions	"The term ontology is employed within philosophy , computer science , and information science with different meanings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To take advantage of what ontology theories have to offer , one should understand what they address and where they come from ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In information science , except for a few papers , there is no initiative toward clarifying what ontology really is and the connections that it fosters among different research fields ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article provides such a clarification .
Research questions	"We begin by revisiting the meaning of the term in its original field , philosophy , to reach its current use in other research fields ."
Research questions	We advocate that ontology is a genuine and relevant subject of research in information science .
Research questions	"Finally , we conclude by offering our view of the opportunities for interdisciplinary research ."
Research findings/conclusions	This multidevice environment increases the popularity of cross-device search activities .
Research findings/conclusions	Cross-device search can be seen as a special case of cross-session search .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous studies regarded re-finding behaviors in cross-session search as task resumption .
Research method	"Based on this , this article proposes considering 2 phases of cross-device search : task preparation and task resumption and to explore their features by modeling ."
Research method	A within-subject user experiment was designed to collect data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Four groups of features were captured from specific behaviors of querying , clicking , gazing , and cognition ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article tested 3 machine-learning methods and found that the C5.0 decision tree performed best .
Research findings/conclusions	"Five features were included in the task preparation behavior model , and 3 in the task resumption behavior model ."
Research method	The difference and relationship between task preparation and task resumption were investigated by comparing their behavioral features .
Research findings/conclusions	It is concluded that information need remains blurred in task preparation and becomes clear in task resumption .
Research findings/conclusions	The changing states of information need suggest an exploratory process in cross-device search .
Research findings/conclusions	We also identify some implications for search engine designers .
Research findings/conclusions	The information has to be organized and synthesized into a coherent whole through relationships and information structures .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"There is hardly any research on the information structure of research papers , and how information structure supports rhetorical and argument structures ."
Research questions	"Thus , this study is focused on information organization in the and Introduction sections of sociology research papers , analyzing the information structure of research objective , question , hypothesis , and result statements ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study is limited to research papers reporting research that investigated cause-effect relations between two concepts .
Research method	"Two semantic frames were developed to specify the types of information associated with cause-effect and comparison relations , and used as coding schemes to annotate the text for different information types ."
Research findings/conclusions	Six link patterns between the two frames were identified-showing how comparisons are used to support the claim that the cause-effect relation is valid .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study demonstrated how semantic frames can be incorporated in discourse analysis to identify deep structures underlying the argument structure .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results carry implications for the knowledge representation of academic research in knowledge graphs , for semantic relation extraction , and teaching of academic writing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that , in most cases , the citations of the award articles are more numerous than the median , belonging to the Top-50 % stratum ."
Research findings/conclusions	Only 15.6 % of the award articles have the status of being the most-cited article of the year in which the article was published ; 24.4 % belong to the Top-5 % stratum of the publication year ; 44.4 % belong to the Top10 % stratum of the publication year ; and 73.3 % belong to the Top-25 % stratum of the publication year .
Research findings/conclusions	"Surprisingly , from 2000 to 2012 , none of the award articles made it to the Top-10 % stratum , apart from the year 2004 ; the leastcited award article received only three citations during a 5-year period ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show a wide range of citations among the Best JASIST Papers .
Research findings/conclusions	This study also observes that the number of articles changed little from 1969 to 1995 but grew rapidly from 1996 to 2012 .
Research findings/conclusions	Suggestions for possible ways to better meet the challenges of the journal 's growth in size and scope in selecting award articles are provided .
Research questions	"Epistemicide is the killing , silencing , annihilation , or devaluing of a knowledge system ."
Research questions	We argue epistemicide happens when epistemic injustices are persistent and systematic and collectively work as a structured and systemic oppression of particular ways of knowing .
Research questions	We present epistemicide as a conceptual approach for understanding and analyzing ways knowledge systems are silenced or devalued within Information Science .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We extend Fricker 's framework by : ( a ) identifying new types of epistemic injustices , and ( b ) by adding to Fricker 's concepts of Primary and Secondary Harm and introducing the concept of a Third Harm happening at an intergenerational level ."
Research questions	Addressing epistemicide is critical for information professionals because we task ourselves with handling knowledge from every field .
Research findings/conclusions	Acknowledgement of and taking steps to interrupt epistemic injustices and these specific harms are supportive of the social justice movements already happening .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper serves as an interruption of epistemic injustice by presenting actions toward justice in the form of operationalized interventions of epistemicide .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It points out , initially , that such aspirations are similar to the now-discredited inductivist approach to science ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the positive side , Big Data may permit larger sample sizes , cheaper and more extensive testing of theories , and the continuous assessment of theories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the negative side , data-driven science encourages passive data collection , as opposed to experimentation and testing , and hornswoggling ( unsound statistical fiddling ) ."
Research questions	"The roles of theory and data in inductive algorithms , statistical modeling , and scientific discoveries are analyzed , and it is argued that theory is needed at every turn ."
Research questions	Data-driven science is a chimera .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper proposes a novel approach for estimating a database 's omitted-citation rate , based on the combined use of 2 or more bibliometric databases ."
Research method	"A statistical model is also presented for ( a ) estimating the true number of citations received by individual papers or sets of papers , and ( b ) defining an appropriate confidence interval ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The proposed approach could represent a first step towards the definition of a standard for evaluating the accuracy level of databases .
Research findings/conclusions	"We investigated the same relationship , but for realistic , complex search tasks required in clinical decision making ."
Research method	One hundred and nine clinicians and final year medical students answered 16 clinical questions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the search engine did improve answer accuracy by 20 percentage points , there was no significant difference when participants used a more effective , state-of-the-art search engine ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also found that the search engine effectiveness difference , identified in the lab , was diminished by around 70 % when the search engines were used with real users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the aid of the search engine , half of the clinical questions were answered incorrectly ."
Research findings/conclusions	We further identified the relative contribution of search engine effectiveness to the overall end task success .
Research findings/conclusions	We found that the ability to interpret documents correctly was a much more important factor impacting task success .
Research findings/conclusions	"If these Research findings/conclusions are representative , information retrieval research may need to reorient its emphasis towards helping users to better understand information , rather than just finding it for them ."
Research questions	"As libraries transition to learning spaces , youth librarians can engage in aspects of democratic design that empowers youth ."
Research questions	Participatory design ( PD ) is a user-centered design method that can support librarians in the democratic development of digital learning spaces .
Research questions	"However , while PD has been used in libraries , we have little knowledge of how youth librarians can act as codesign partners ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We need a conceptual model to understand the role of youth librarians in codesign , and how their experiences are integrated into youth design partnerships ."
Research method	"To generate this model , we examine a case study of the evolutionary process of a single librarian and the development of a library system 's learning activities through PD ."
Research method	"Using the idea of equal design partnerships , we analyzed video recordings and stakeholder interviews on how children ( ages 7-11 ) worked together with a librarian to develop new digital learning activities ."
Research questions	Our discussion focuses on the development of a participatory librarian design conceptual model that situates librarians as design partners with youth .
Research questions	The article concludes with recommendations for integrating PD methods into libraries to create digital learning spaces and suggestions for moving forward with this design perspective .
Research method	The U.S. has 11 federal agencies dedicated to supporting programs and providing funding for research and curriculum development .
Research findings/conclusions	"The domain of STEM education has significant implications in preparing the desired workforce with the requisite knowledge , developing appropriate curricula , providing teachers the necessary professional development , focusing research dollars on areas that have maximum impact , and developing national educational policy and standards ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A complex undertaking such as STEM education , which attracts interest and valuable resources from a number of stakeholders needs to be well understood ."
Research method	"In light of this , we attempt to describe the underlying structure of STEM education , its core areas , and their relationships through co-word analyses of the titles , keywords , and abstracts of the relevant literature using visualization and bibliometric mapping tools ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications are drawn with respect to the nature of STEM education as well as curriculum and policy development .
Research method	"To define the style of each presidency , we have applied a principal component analysis ( PCA ) based on the part-of-speech ( POS ) frequencies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From Roosevelt ( 1934 ) , each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters , a factor that is more important than political affiliation ."
Research method	"Using the 300 most frequent word-types , we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This second view shares similarities with the first one , but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7 % under some constraints ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When an incorrect assignment is detected , the proposed author often belongs to the same party and has lived during roughly the same time period as the presumed author ."
Research findings/conclusions	A deeper analysis of some incorrect assignments reveals interesting reasons justifying difficult attributions .
Research questions	"Missing citation metadata in scholarly databases , however , create problems for classical citation-based ranking algorithms and challenge the performance of citation-based retrieval systems ."
Research method	"In this research , we utilize a two-step citation analysis method to investigate the importance of publications for which citation information is partially missing ."
Research method	"First , we calculate the importance of the author and then use his importance to estimate the publication importance for some selected articles ."
Research method	"To evaluate this method , we designed a simulation experimentrandom citation-missingto test the two-step citation analysis that we carried out with the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) Digital Library ( DL ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this experiment , we simulated different scenarios in a large-scale scientific digital library , from high-quality citation data , to very poor quality data , The results show that a two-step citation analysis can effectively uncover the importance of publications in different situations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More importantly , we found that the optimized impact from the importance of an author ( first step ) is exponentially increased when the quality of citation decreases ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions from this study can further enhance citation-based publication-ranking algorithms for real-world applications .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most theoretical and empirical studies are centered on information needs and seeking , rather than on information outcomes ."
Research questions	This review 's Research questions is to explore and explain health outcomes of Online Consumer Health Information ( OCHI ) in primary care .
Research method	A participatory systematic mixed studies review with a framework synthesis was undertaken .
Research method	"Starting from an initial conceptual framework , our specific objectives were to ( a ) identify types of OCHI outcomes in primary care , ( b ) identify factors associated with these outcomes , and ( c ) integrate these factors and outcomes into a comprehensive revised framework combining an information theory and a psychosocial theory of behavior ."
Research method	The results of 65 included studies were synthesized using a qualitative thematic data analysis .
Research method	The themes derived from the literature underwent a harmonization process that produced a comprehensive typology of OCHI outcomes .
Research findings/conclusions	"The revised conceptual framework specifies four individual and one organizational level of OCHI outcomes , while including factors such as consumers ' information needs and four interdependent contextual factors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It contributes to theoretical knowledge about OCHI health outcomes , and informs future research , information assessment methods , and tools to help consumers find and use health information ."
Research method	"The hypothesis is that a wide range of heterogeneous data resources can be characterized and classified due to their particular configurations of hypertext features such as scripts , links , interactive processes , and time scalings , and that the hypertext configuration is a major but not sole source of the messiness of big data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The notion of hypertext will be revalidated , placed at the center of the interpretation of networked digital media , and used in the analysis of the fast-growing amounts of heterogeneous digital collections , assemblages , and corpora ."
Research findings/conclusions	The introduction summarizes the wider background of a fast-changing data landscape .
Research method	"Citation and content analysis were applied to articles grouped by accessibility ( libre , gratis , and fee for access ) for various bibliometric attributes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Open access literature does not differ from fee-for-access literature in terms of impact factor , detection of error , or change in postretraction citation rates ."
Research findings/conclusions	Literature found in the PubMed Central Open Access subset provides detailed information about the nature of the anomaly more often than less accessible works .
Research findings/conclusions	"Open access literature appears to be of similar reliability and integrity as the population of biomedical literature in general , with the added value of being more forthcoming about the nature of errors when they are identified ."
Research questions	"With several commercial entities providing these electronic resources , the result can be silo systems and processes to evaluate cost and usage of these resources , making it difficult to provide meaningful analytics ."
Research method	"In this research , we examine a subset of journals from a large research library using a web analytics approach with the goal of developing a framework for the analysis of library subscriptions ."
Research method	"This foundational approach is implemented by comparing the impact to the cost , titles , and usage for the subset of journals and by assessing the funding area ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results highlight the benefit of a web analytics evaluation framework for university libraries and the impact of classifying titles based on the funding area ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , they show the statistical difference in both use and cost among the various funding areas when ranked by cost , eliminating the outliers of heavily used and highly expensive journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	Future work includes refining this model for a larger scale analysis tying metrics to library organizational objectives and for the creation of an online application to automate this analysis .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These services are valuable because users get an enhanced search experience .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the compiled user profiles may contain sensitive information that might represent a privacy threat ."
Research findings/conclusions	This issue should be addressed in a way that it also preserves the utility of the profile with regard to search services .
Research questions	State-of-the-art approaches tackle these issues by generating and submitting fake queries that are related to the interests of the user .
Research findings/conclusions	This technique allows the WSE to only know general ( and useful ) data while the detailed ( and potentially private ) data are obfuscated .
Research findings/conclusions	"To build fake queries , these proposals rely on past queries to obtain user interests ."
Research questions	"However , we argue that this is not always the best strategy and , in this article , we study the use of social networks to gather more accurate user profiles that enable better personalized service while offering a similar , or even better , level of practical privacy ."
Research method	These hypotheses are empirically supported by evaluations using real profiles gathered from Twitter and a set of AOL search queries .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Digital preservation research has focused on identifying technical , economic , and organizational sources of risk and has relied on an assumption that individuals will behave in rational and predictable ways in response to the same information ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article asserts that viewing digital preservation as a process that takes place in complex social contexts is just as important as thinking about digital preservation in terms of technological or economic issues .
Research questions	"This is particularly important for understanding how individuals involved in digital preservation construct their understanding of risk because social factors influence how people construct their understanding of , and behave in response to , risk information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The author proposes an eight-factor model for the social construction of risk , which includes : communication , complexity , expertise , organizations , political culture , trust , uncertainty , and vulnerability ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The article demonstrates how these factors influence individuals as they construct their understanding of risk in the context of digital preservation and how this in turn affects digital preservation decisions .
Research method	"To assess how common such practices are and whether they vary by discipline , gender , and country , the authors conducted a large-scale e-mail survey of astronomy and astrophysics , public health , environmental engineering , and philosophy across 15 European countries and analyzed hyperlinks from web CVs of academics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"About 60 % of the 2,154 survey responses reported having a web CV or something similar , and there were differences between disciplines , genders , and countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A follow-up outlink analysis of 2,700 web CVs found that a third had at least one outlink to an OA target , typically a public eprint archive or an individual self-archived file ."
Research findings/conclusions	This proportion was considerably higher in astronomy ( 48 % ) and philosophy ( 37 % ) than in environmental engineering ( 29 % ) and public health ( 21 % ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"There were also differences in linking to publishers ' websites , resources , and discussions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Perhaps most important , however , the amount of linking to OA publications seems to be much lower than allowed by publishers and journals , suggesting that many opportunities for disseminating full-text research online are being missed , especially in disciplines without established repositories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , few academics seem to be exploiting their CVs to link to discussions , resources , or article abstracts , which seems to be another missed opportunity for publicizing research ."
Research method	"Four indicators , the mean reference rate per page , the percentage of references to Web of Science journal literature , the mean reference age , and Price Index , were applied to analyze the reference patterns of three publication types : books , book chapter articles and journal articles ."
Research method	"References of publications indexed in Web of Science Core Collection were analyzed for two periods ( 2005-2009 , 2010-2013 ) and across 15 disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	Journal article authors cite more recent references and more references from serial publications than monograph authors .
Research findings/conclusions	The difference between the sciences and the SSH is as obvious as the difference between periodical and non-serial publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the reference patterns of social sciences are much more similar to science fields than humanities , especially for monographs ."
Research findings/conclusions	The subject characteristics of reference pattern are strongly affected by publication types .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , journal publications have stronger associations between ageing indicators and the share of WoS journal references than monographs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Counts of the number of patents citing an organization 's website may therefore provide an indicator of its technological capacity or relevance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article introduces methods to extract URL citations from patents and evaluates the usefulness of counts of patent web citations as a technology indicator .
Research findings/conclusions	"An analysis of patents citing 200 US universities or 177 UK universities found computer science and engineering departments to be frequently cited , as well as research-related webpages , such as Wikipedia , YouTube , or the Internet Archive ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , however , patent URL citations seem to be frequent enough to be useful for ranking major US and the top few UK universities if popular hosted subdomains are filtered out , but the hit count estimates on the first search engine results page should not be relied upon for accuracy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The specialties investigated are systems librarian , electronic resource librarian , digital librarian , institutional repository manager , clinical librarian and informationist , digital curator/research data manager , teaching librarian/information literacy educator , and information and knowledge manager ."
Research method	"Piecemeal literature based on job advertisements , surveys , and individual case studies is consolidated to offer a novel perspective on the evolution of the profession ."
Research findings/conclusions	The resilience of the profession 's core jurisdiction is apparent despite pressures to erode it .
Research questions	"Forays into teaching , and more recently into open access and data management , can be understood as responses to such pressure ."
Research findings/conclusions	The attractions but also the risks of embedded roles and overextended claims become apparent when comparing past and prospective specialties .
Research questions	"Prior art patent search is the task of identifying related patents for a given patent file , and is an essential step in judging the validity of a patent application ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes an automated query generation and postprocessing method for prior art patent search .
Research method	The proposed approach first constructs structured queries by combining terms extracted from different fields of a query patent and then reranks the retrieved patents by utilizing the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) code similarities between the query patent and the retrieved patents along with the retrieval score .
Research findings/conclusions	"An extensive set of empirical results carried out on a large-scale , real-world dataset shows that utilizing 20 or 30 query terms extracted from all fields of an original query patent according to their log ( tf ) idf values helps form a representative search query out of the query patent and is found to be more effective than is using any number of query terms from any single field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is shown that combining terms extracted from different fields of the query patent by giving higher importance to terms extracted from the abstract , claims , and description fields than to terms extracted from the title field is more effective than treating all extracted terms equally while forming the search query ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , utilizing the similarities between the IPC codes of the query patent and retrieved patents is shown to be beneficial to improve the effectiveness of the prior art search ."
Research questions	"However , the majority of TC algorithms assume that the underlying data distribution does not change over time ."
Research questions	"In this work , we are concerned with the challenges imposed by the temporal dynamics observed in textual data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide evidence of the existence of temporal effects in three textual data sets , reflected by variations observed over time in the class distribution , in the pairwise class similarities , and in the relationships between terms and classes ."
Research method	"We then quantify , using a series of full factorial design experiments , the impact of these effects on four well-known TC algorithms ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that these temporal effects affect each analyzed data set differently and that they restrict the performance of each considered TC algorithm to different extents .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The reported quantitative analyses , which are the original contributions of this article , provide valuable new insights to better understand the behavior of TC algorithms when faced with nonstatic ( temporal ) data distributions and highlight important requirements for the proposal of more accurate classification models ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This makes it difficult for users to pick relevant documents , especially given that they are not knowledgeable of the topics ."
Research questions	"To explore how systems can better help users find relevant documents from search results , the current research analyzed document selection behaviors of users with different levels of domain knowledge ( DK ) ."
Research method	Data were collected in a laboratory study with 35 participants each searching on four tasks in the genomics domain .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that users with high and low DK levels selected different sets of documents to view ; those high in DK read more documents and gave higher relevance ratings for the viewed documents than those low in DK did .
Research findings/conclusions	"Users with low DK tended to select documents ranking toward the top of the search result lists , and those with high in DK tended to also select documents ranking down the search result lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions help design search systems that can personalize search results to users with different levels of DK .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although citation counts are a recognized indicator of scholarly impact , alternative data is needed to provide evidence of other types of impact , including within education and wider society ."
Research findings/conclusions	Wikipedia is a logical choice for both of these because the role of a general encyclopaedia is to be an understandable repository of facts about a diverse array of topics and hence it may cite research to support its claims .
Research method	"To test whether Wikipedia could provide new evidence about the impact of scholarly research , this article counted citations to 302,328 articles and 18,735 monographs in English indexed by Scopus in the period 2005 to 2012 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that citations from Wikipedia to articles are too rare for most research evaluation Research questionss , with only 5 % of articles being cited in all fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , a third of monographs have at least one citation from Wikipedia , with the most in the arts and humanities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , Wikipedia citations can provide extra impact evidence for academic monographs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , the results may be relatively easily manipulated and so Wikipedia is not recommended for evaluations affecting stakeholder interests ."
Research questions	"However , creating such detailed metadata can be onerous , and there are few structured methods for doing so ."
Research method	"In this case study of data curation in support of geobiology research conducted at Yellowstone National Park , we describe a method of Research Process Modeling for documenting noncomputational data provenance in a structured yet flexible way ."
Research method	"The method combines systems analysis techniques to model research activities , the World Wide Web Consortium Provenance ( PROV ) ontology to illustrate relationships between data products , and simple inventory methods to account for research processes and data products ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It also supports collaborative data curation between information professionals and researchers , and is therefore a significant step toward producing more useable and interpretable research data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We demonstrate how this method describes data provenance more robustly than flat metadata alone and fills a critical gap in the documentation of provenance for field-based and noncomputational workflows .
Research questions	We discuss potential applications of this approach to other research domains .
Research method	"Using a content analysis approach to determine data breach severity attributes ( measured by the total number of breached records , type of data accessed , the source of the data breach , and how the data were used ) , in conjunction with readability measures ( reading complexity , numerical intensity , length of letter , word size , and unique words ) , 512 data breach incidents from 281 U.S. firms across the 2012-2015 period were examined ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that data breach severity has a positive impact on reading complexity , length of letter , word size , and unique words , and a negative impact on numerical terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Interpreting the results collectively through the lens of impression management , it can be inferred that business managers may be attempting to obfuscate bad news associated with high data breach severity incidents by manipulating syntactical features of the data breach notification letters in a way that makes the message difficult for individuals to comprehend ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study contributes to the information studies and impression management behavior literatures by analyzing linguistic cues in notifications following a data breach incident .
Research questions	"Existing conceptual models such as the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) are not adequate to represent the unique descriptive attributes , levels of variance , and relationships among video games ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous video game-specific models tend to focus on the development of video games and their technical aspects .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our model instead attempts to reflect how users such as game players , collectors , and scholars understand video games and the relationships among them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We specifically consider use cases of gamers , with future intentions of using this conceptual model as a foundation for developing a union catalog for various libraries and museums ."
Research questions	"In the process of developing the model , we encountered many challenges , including conceptual overlap with and divergence from FRBR , entity scoping , complex relationships among entities , and the question of how to model additional content for game expansion ."
Research findings/conclusions	Future work will focus on making this model interoperable with existing ontologies as well as further understanding and description of content and relationships .
Research findings/conclusions	It is found that closely related areas have a high propensity to share a larger number of common authors .
Research method	"A method for comparing areas of vastly different sizes and to handle name homonymy is constructed , allowing for the robust deployment of this method on real data sets ."
Research method	A statistical analysis of the probability distributions of the common author overlap that accounts for noise is carried out along with the production of network maps with weighted links proportional to the overlap strength .
Research findings/conclusions	"This is demonstrated on 2 case studies , complexity science and neutrino physics , where the level of relatedness of areas within each area is expected to vary greatly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is found that the results returned by this method closely match the intuitive expectation that the broad , multidisciplinary area of complexity science possesses areas that are weakly related to each other , whereas the much narrower area of neutrino physics shows very strongly related areas ."
Research method	"We focus on a specific phenomenon : users reading several articles related to a particular news development , which we call story-focused reading ."
Research questions	Our goal is to understand the effect of story-focused reading on user engagement and how news sites can support this phenomenon .
Research findings/conclusions	We found that most users focus on stories that interest them and that even casual news readers engage in story-focused reading .
Research findings/conclusions	"During story-focused reading , users spend more time reading and a larger number of news sites are involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , readers employ different strategies to find articles related to a story ."
Research questions	"We also analyze how news sites promote story-focused reading by looking at how they link their articles to related content published by them , or by other sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that providing links to related content leads to a higher engagement of the users , and that this is the case even for links to external sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also show that the performance of links can be affected by their type , their position , and how many of them are present within an article ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To induce rational regulations for protecting personal information , it is necessary to separately estimate consumers ' values related to different types of personal information ."
Research method	"In this article , discrete choice experiments using hypothetical information leakage situations given certain compensation amounts and discrete choice models were used to quantitatively analyze the value of personal information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that consumers generally place high value on information that could cause immediate and actual damage from the leakage after identification , such as basic personal information and purchase list and payment information ."
Research questions	Consumers value location information and personal medical information differently based on their perceived importance of privacy and their prior experience with personal information leakage .
Research findings/conclusions	We suggest that the level of regulation should differ according to the type of personal information based on the consumers ' valuation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article contributes to a better understanding of a quantitative approach to pricing personal information .
Research questions	The identification of such concepts is a challenging prediction task that would help multiple parties-including researchers and the general public-focus their attention within the vast scientific literature .
Research method	"In this paper we present a system that predicts the future impact of a scientific concept , represented as a technical term , based on the information available from recently published research articles ."
Research method	"We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived from the full-text of the articles through a variety of approaches , including rhetorical sentence analysis , information extraction , and time-series analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results from two large-scale experiments with 3.8 million full-text articles and 48 million metadata records support the conclusion that full-text features are significantly more useful for prediction than metadata-only features and that the most accurate predictions result from combining the metadata and full-text features .
Research findings/conclusions	"Surprisingly , these results hold even when the metadata features are available for a much larger number of documents than are available for the full-text features ."
Research questions	"Simply stated , these students tend to believe that they have above-average IL skills , when , in fact , an objective test of their ability indicates that they are below-proficient in terms of their actual skills ."
Research method	"This investigation was part of an Institute of Museum and Library Services-funded project and includes demographic data about participants , their scores on an objective test of their information literacy skills , and self-estimates of their ability ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions support previous research that indicates many students come to college without proficient IL skills , that students with below-proficient IL skills have inflated views of their ability , and that this miscalibration can also be expressed by students who test as proficient ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for research and practice are discussed .
Research questions	"These are core concerns for researchers working within the area of critical information studies-yet these companies have also demonstrated novel tactics for obscuring their operations , reducing the ability of scholars to speak about how harms are perpetuated or to link them to larger systems ."
Research questions	"While scholars ' methods and ethical conventions have historically privileged the agency of research participants , the current landscape suggests the value of exploring methods that would reveal actions that are Research questionsfully hidden ."
Research questions	"We propose investigation as a model for critical information studies and review the methods and epistemological conventions of investigative journalists as a provocative example , noting that their orientation toward those in power enables them to discuss societal harms in ways that academic researchers often can not ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude by discussing key topics , such as process accountability and institutional norms , that should feature in discussions of how academic researchers might position investigation in relation to their own work ."
Research questions	"However , access to this information can sometimes be restricted or blocked in various ways ."
Research method	"This research adopts Jaeger and Burnett 's ( 2005 ) conceptualization of information access as the presence of a robust system through which information is made available to citizens and others ( p. 465 ) with physical , intellectual , and social components ."
Research method	This provides the conceptual framework through which incidents of restricted access to science policy ( RASP ) were analyzed in a comparative case study .
Research findings/conclusions	"The research found that citizens ' physical , intellectual , and social access to scientific research was restricted in these cases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the theoretical framework of democratic accountability held normative and symbolic power for the respondents ; although democratic accountability did not accurately predict respondents ' actions , it was used as a significant justification for their actions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research suggests that the conceptual framework of information access ( with physical , intellectual , and social components ) and the theoretical framework of democratic accountability ( although primarily normative ) may be useful approaches to subsequent investigations of censorship and restricted access in other situations and research areas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the demand for academic materials produced in nonWestern societies is increasing among English-speaking users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In order to search among such material , users rely on keywords such as author names ."
Research questions	"However , Asian nations such as Korea and China have markedly different methods of writing personal names from Western naming traditions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among these differences are name components , structure , writing customs , and distribution of surnames ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These differences influence the Anglicization of Asian academic researchers ' names , often leading to them being written in various fashions , unlike Western personal names ."
Research questions	These inconsistent formats can often lead to difficulties in searching and finding academic materials for Western users unfamiliar with Korean and Asian personal names .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents methods for precisely understanding and categorizing Korean personal names in order to make academic materials by Korean authors easier to find for Westerners .
Research questions	"As such , this article discusses characteristics particular to Korean personal names and furthermore analyzes how the personal names of Korean academic researchers are currently being written in English ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our longitudinal analysis shows , among other things , that the bandwidth share distributions-and thus bandwidth differences-exhibit considerable path dependence where country proportions of international bandwidth in 2011 can be substantially accounted for by a preferential attachment-based mixture of micro-level processes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our preferential attachment model , consistent with empirical data , does not predict increasing concentration of bandwidth within top-ranked countries ."
Research questions	"We argue that recognizing the strong , but nuanced , historical inertia of bandwidth distributions is helpful in better discriminating among competing theoretical perspectives on the global digital divide as well as in clarifying policy discussions related to gaps between bandwidth-rich and bandwidth-poor countries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Specifically , through the lens of trust judgments , it demonstrates that gender is a determinant of the information evaluation process ."
Research method	A questionnaire-based survey collected data from adults regarding the factors that influence their judgment of the trustworthiness of online health information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Both men and women identified credibility , recommendation , ease of use , and brand as being of importance in their trust judgments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , women also take into account style , while men eschew this for familiarity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , men appear to be more concerned with the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the information , the ease with which they can access it , and its familiarity , whereas women demonstrate greater interest in cognition , such as the ease with which they can read and understand the information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These gender differences are consistent with the demographic data , which suggest that : women consult more types of sources than men ; men are more likely to be searching with respect to a long-standing health complaint ; and , women are more likely than men to use tablets in their health information seeking ."
Research findings/conclusions	Recommendations for further research to better inform practice are offered .
Research questions	The goal of this study is to evaluate the change in user assessment of search results and explore how users ' judgements change .
Research method	"To this end , we conducted a large-scale user study with 86 participants who evaluated 2 different queries and 4 diverse result sets twice with an interval of 2 months ."
Research questions	To analyze the results we investigate whether 2 types of patterns of user behavior from the theory of categorical thinking hold for the case of evaluation of search results : ( a ) coarseness and ( b ) locality .
Research method	To quantify these patterns we devised 2 new measures of change in user judgements and distinguish between local ( when users swap between close ranks and relevance values ) and nonlocal changes .
Research method	"Two types of judgements were considered in this study : ( a ) relevance on a 4-point scale , and ( b ) ranking on a 10-point scale without ties ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that users tend to change their judgements of the results over time in about 50 % of cases for relevance and in 85 % of cases for ranking .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the majority of these changes were local ."
Research method	The study adopts a two-stage sequential mixed-methods design .
Research method	The first stage is a quantitative survey of 447 citizens from two countries .
Research method	The second stage involves 50 qualitative interviews which further untangle the roles of privacy concern and benefits .
Research findings/conclusions	The integrated Research findings/conclusions provide evidence that a privacy paradox exists .
Research questions	"While individuals continue to express a high desire for privacy , their consideration of the benefits and privacy concerns prior to adoption is largely skewed toward the benefits , due to a lack of privacy knowledge , emphasis on immediate gratification , overestimation of the benefits , and underestimation of the risks ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study further extends the privacy calculus theory to the health context and acknowledges the factors impacting this comparison of benefits and privacy concerns prior to and postadoption of a new technology .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study provides actionable insights for practice , highlighting the importance of privacy education to foster awareness and control mechanisms to negate the potential negative effects of privacy concern ."
Research method	"Thus , a journal-journal matrix including simultaneously fractionalized values of direct citation , cocitation , and coupling was symmetrized by cosine similarity and later transformed into distances before performing clustering ."
Research method	The results provided a new cluster-based subject structure comprising 290 clusters that emerge by executing Ward 's clustering in two phases and using a mixed labeling procedure based on tf-idf scores of the original SJR category tags and significant words extracted from journal titles .
Research method	"In total , 13,716 SJR journals were classified using this new cluster-based scheme ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although more than 5,000 journals were omitted in the classification process , the method produced a consistent classification with a balanced structure of coherent and well-defined clusters , a moderated multiassignment of journals , and a softer concentration of journals over clusters than in the original SJR categories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"New subject disciplines such as nanoscience and nanotechnology or social work were also detected , providing evidence of good performance of our approach in refining the journal classification and updating the subject classification structure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the analysis of web ad effectiveness has achieved excellent results , there are still some deficiencies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , there is a lack of an in-depth study of the relevance between advertisements and web content ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , there is not a thorough analysis of the impacts of users and advertising features on user browsing behaviors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"And last , the evaluation index of the web advertisement effect is not adequate ."
Research method	"Given the above problems , we conducted our work by studying the observer 's behavioral pattern based on multimodal features ."
Research method	"First , we analyze the correlation between ads and links with different searching results and further assess the influence of relevance on the observer 's attention to web ads using eye-movement features ."
Research method	Then we investigate the user 's behavioral sequence and propose the directional frequent-browsing pattern algorithm for mining the user 's most commonly used browsing patterns .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we offer the novel use of memory as a new measure of advertising effectiveness and further build an advertising memory model with integrated multimodal features for predicting the efficacy of web ads ."
Research method	A large number of experiments have proved the superiority of our method .
Research findings/conclusions	"Most manifestly , the research mission of universities appears to be divisive ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Authors have claimed that the Swedish system , while formally unified , has developed into a binary state , and statistics seem to support this conclusion ."
Research method	"This article makes use of a comprehensive statistical data source on Swedish higher education institutions to illustrate stratification , and uses literature on Swedish research policy history to contextualize the statistics ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Highlighting the opportunities as well as constraints of the data , the article argues that there is great merit in combining statistics with a qualitative analysis when studying the structural characteristics of national higher education systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	Not least the article shows that it is an over-simplification to describe the Swedish system as binary ; the stratification is more complex .
Research questions	"On basis of the analysis , the article also argues that while global trends certainly influence national developments , higher education systems have country-specific features that may enrich the understanding of how systems evolve and therefore should be analyzed as part of a broader study of the increasingly globalized academic system ."
Research questions	"In signed social networks ( SSNs ) where type of link is also considered besides the links itself , CD aims to partition the network in such a way to have less positive inter-connections and less negative intra-connections among communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"So , approaches used for CD in unsigned networks do not perform well when directly applied on signed networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most of the CD algorithms are based on single objective optimization criteria of optimizing modularity which focuses only on link density without considering the type of links existing in the network .
Research method	"In this work , a multiobjective approach for CD in SSNs is proposed considering both the link density as well as the sign of links ."
Research method	"Precisely we are developing a method using modularity , frustration and social balance factor as multiple objectives to be optimized ( M-F-SBF model ) ."
Research method	NSGA-II algorithm is used to maintain elitism and diversity in the solutions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments are performed on both existing benchmarked and real-world datasets show that our approach has led to better solutions , clearly indicating the effectiveness of our proposed M-F-SBF model ."
Research questions	"Due to the differences in users ' preferences , different users care about different kinds of information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the meantime , different elements within each kind of information are differentially informative for user tagging behaviors ."
Research questions	"In this context , how to effectively integrate different elements and different information separately becomes a key part of tag recommendation ."
Research questions	"However , the existing methods ignore this key part ."
Research questions	"In order to address this problem , we propose a deep neural network for tag recommendation ."
Research method	"Specifically , we model two important attentive aspects with a hierarchical attention model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For different user-item pairs , the bottom layered attention network models the influence of different elements on the features representation of the information while the top layered attention network models the attentive scores of different information ."
Research method	"To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method , we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that using attention network and different kinds of information can significantly improve the performance of the recommendation model , and verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In an Internet-based experiment ( N = 106 ) with temporarily activated motivational orientation ( promotion vs. prevention ) and message goal frames ( gain vs. loss ) as independent variables , it was demonstrated that participants selected information that was congruent with their motivational orientation although they did not necessarily spend more time attending to their selection ."
Research findings/conclusions	Participants with the promotion orientation exhibited more scanning behavior and viewed more web pages but spent less time on the Internet search .
Research findings/conclusions	"Congruency effects resulted in higher user engagement , which mediated the congruency effects on the perceived message quality of the health content ."
Research method	"Google Trends , which provides information about the queries searched by users of the Google web search engine , is a rich data source from which a wealth of information can be mined ."
Research method	We investigated the possibility of using web search volume data from Google Trends to predict academic fame .
Research method	"As queries are language-dependent , we studied universities from two countries with different languages , the United States and Spain ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found a significant correlation between the search volume of a university name and the university 's academic reputation or fame .
Research questions	"We also examined the effect of some Google Trends features , namely , limiting the search to a specific country or topic category on the search volume data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we examined the effect of university sizes on the correlations found to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the relationships ."
Research questions	"The Research questions of this study is to examine Christian icons-typically tempera paintings on wooden panels-as information objects , as documents : documents that obtain meaning through tradition and standardization , documents around which a sophisticated scaffolding of classification and categorization has developed , documents that highlight their own materiality ."
Research questions	Theological arguments that associate the icon with the Incarnation are juxtaposed with theories on the materiality of the document and information as thing .
Research method	Icons are examined as visual and multimedia documents : all icons are graphic ; many also incorporate textual information .
Research questions	"Icons emerge as a complex information resource : a resource-with origins in the earliest years of Christianity-that developed over centuries with accompanying systems of standardization and classification , a resource at the center of theological and political differences that shook empires , a primarily visual resource within a theological framework that affords the visual equal status with the textual , a resource with enduring relevance to hundreds of millions of Christians , a resource that continues to evolve as ancient and modern icons take on new material forms made possible through digital technologies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"And crist was all , by reason as I preve , Firste a prophete by holy informacion , And by his doctryne , most worthy of byleve ."

Research findings/conclusions	"However , these solutions besides being very expensive and having scalability problems , also may not benefit from eventual manual corrections , as they may be lost whenever the process of disambiguating the entire repository is required ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the real world , in which repositories are updated on a daily basis , incremental solutions that disambiguate only the newly introduced citation records , are likely to produce improved results in the long run ."
Research questions	"However , the problem of incremental author name disambiguation has been largely neglected in the literature ."
Research method	"In this article we present a new author name disambiguation method , specially designed for the incremental scenario ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In our experiments , our new method largely outperforms recent incremental proposals reported in the literature as well as the current state-of-the-art non-incremental method ."
Research questions	Current subject indexing systems do not make adequate distinctions on the importance of assigned subject descriptors .
Research findings/conclusions	Assigning numeric weights to subject descriptors to distinguish their importance to the documents can strengthen the role of subject metadata .
Research findings/conclusions	Automated methods are more cost-effective .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study compares different automated weighting methods in different environments .
Research method	Two evaluation methods were used to assess the performance .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments on three datasets in the biomedical domain suggest the performance of different weighting methods depends on whether it is an abstract or full text environment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Mutual information with bag-of-words representation shows the best average performance in the full text environment , while cosine with bag-of-words representation is the best in an abstract environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	The cosine measure has relatively consistent and robust performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"A direct weighting method , IDF ( Inverse Document Frequency ) , can produce quick and reasonable estimates of the weights ."
Research findings/conclusions	Bag-of-words representation generally outperforms the concept-based representation .
Research findings/conclusions	Further improvement in performance can be obtained by using the learning-to-rank method to integrate different weighting methods .
Research questions	"This study follows up Lu and Mao ( Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology , 66 , 1776-1784 , 2015 ) , in which an automated weighted subject indexing method was proposed and validated ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions from this study contribute to more effective weighted subject indexing .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some articles become instantly cited , whereas others go unnoticed for some time before they are discovered or rediscovered ."

Research questions	I briefly discuss an extreme case of a sleeping beauty .
Research findings/conclusions	Peirce 's short note in Science in 1884 shows a remarkable increase in citations since around 2000 .
Research findings/conclusions	"The note received less than 1 citation per year in the decades prior to 2000 , 3.5 citations per year in the 2000s , and 10.4 in the 2010s ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This increase was seen in several domains , most notably meteorology , medical prediction research , and economics ."
Research method	The paper outlines formulas to evaluate a binary prediction system for a binary outcome .
Research findings/conclusions	"This citation increase in various domains may be attributed to a widespread , growing research focus on mathematical prediction systems and the evaluation thereof ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Several recently suggested evaluation measures essentially reinvented or extended Peirce 's 120-year-old ideas .
Research questions	"Although different text models have been proposed , they typically target specific task aspects in isolation , such as time efficiency , accuracy , or applicability for different scenarios ."
Research questions	"Here we present Bag of Textual Graphs ( BoTG ) , a general text representation model that addresses these three requirements at the same time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed textual representation is based on a graph-based scheme that encodes term proximity and term ordering , and represents text documents into an efficient vector space that addresses all these aspects as well as provides discriminative textual patterns ."
Research method	Extensive experiments are conducted in two experimental scenarios-classification and retrieval-considering multiple well-known text collections .
Research method	We also compare our model against several methods from the literature .
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results demonstrate that our model is generic enough to handle different tasks and collections .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is also more efficient than the widely used state-of-the-art methods in textual classification and retrieval tasks , with a competitive effectiveness , sometimes with gains by large margins ."
Research questions	"In the last few years , strategies that are based on the explicit knowledge of query aspects emerged as highly effective ways of diversifying search results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our contributions in this article are two-fold .
Research questions	"First , we extensively evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art explicit diversification strategy and pin-point its potential weaknesses ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose basic yet novel optimizations to remedy these weaknesses and boost the performance of this algorithm .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As a second contribution , inspired by the success of the current diversification strategies that exploit the relevance of the candidate documents to individual query aspects , we cast the diversification problem into the problem of ranking aggregation ."
Research method	"To this end , we propose to materialize the re-rankings of the candidate documents for each query aspect and then merge these rankings by adapting the score ( -based ) and rank ( -based ) aggregation methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our extensive experimental evaluations show that certain ranking aggregation methods are superior to existing explicit diversification strategies in terms of diversification effectiveness .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , these ranking aggregation methods have lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art diversification strategies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While the practices draw on a common set of tools , techniques , and technologies , most contributions to the debate come either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with a focus on a domain-specific issue ."
Research findings/conclusions	A close examination of these contributions reveals a set of common problematics that arise in various guises and in different places .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data .
Research questions	"The Research questions of this article is to provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences , humanities , policy , and trade literature ."
Research questions	"In bringing these diverse literatures together , we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and affect all of these areas ."
Research questions	"By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within larger socioeconomic developments , we also seek to provide a broader understanding of its drivers , barriers , and challenges ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This approach allows us to identify attributes of Big Data that require more attention-autonomy , opacity , generativity , disparity , and futurity-leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas ."
Research questions	"Authorship verification is considered an extremely difficult task in computational text classification , because it does not assume that the correct author of an anonymous text is included in the candidate authors available ."
Research method	"To determine whether 2 documents have been written by the same author , the verification method discussed uses repeated feature subsampling and a pool of impostor authors ."
Research method	We use this technique to attribute a newly discovered Latin text from antiquity ( the Compendiosa expositio ) to Apuleius .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This North African writer was one of the most important authors of the Roman Empire in the 2 ( nd ) century and authored one of the world 's first novels .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This attribution has profound and wide-reaching cultural value , because it has been over a century since a new text by a major author from antiquity was discovered ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research therefore illustrates the rapidly growing potential of computational methods for studying the global textual heritage .
Research questions	"However , measuring China 's research output remains a challenge because Chinese scholars may publish their research in either international or national journals , yet no bibliometric database covers both the Chinese and English scientific literature ."
Research questions	"The Research questions of this study is to compare Web of Science ( WoS ) with a Chinese bibliometric database in terms of authors and their performance , demonstrate the extent of the overlap between the two groups of Chinese most productive authors in both international and Chinese bibliometric databases , and determine how different disciplines may affect this overlap ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of this study indicate that Chinese bibliometric databases , or a combination of WoS and Chinese bibliometric databases , should be used to evaluate Chinese research performance except in the few disciplines in which Chinese research performance could be assessed using WoS only ."
Research questions	They can make the content of knowledge organization systems ( KOS ) available both for human and machine access .
Research method	"The paper describes the attributes and functionality for a TR , based on a review of published literature , existing TRs , and a survey of experts ."
Research method	A domain model based on user tasks is constructed and a set of core metadata elements for use in TRs is proposed .
Research findings/conclusions	"Ideally , the TR should allow searching as well as browsing for a KOS , matching a user 's search while also providing information about existing terminology services , accessible to both humans and machines ."
Research questions	"The issues surrounding metadata for KOS are also discussed , together with the rationale for different aspects and the importance of a core set of KOS metadata for future machine-based access ; a possible core set of metadata elements is proposed ."
Research method	This is dealt with in terms of practical experience and in relation to the Dublin Core Application Profile .
Research questions	Yet little is known about the influences on these and ways in which academics might manage this approach to dissemination .
Research method	Three groups of papers by academics in a center for speech-language-science ( available through a university repository ) were compared .
Research method	"The first group of target papers were blogged , and the blogs were systematically tweeted ."
Research method	"The second group of connected control papers were nonblogged papers that we carefully matched for author , topic , and year of publication ."
Research method	The third group were papers by different staff members on a variety of topics-Unrelated Control Papers .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest an effect of social media on download rate , which was limited not just to Target Papers but also generalized to Connected Control Papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Unrelated Control Papers showed no increase over the same amount of time ( main effect of time , F ( 1,27 ) = 55.6 , p < .001 ) ; Significant Group x Time Interaction , F ( 2,27 ) = 7.9 , p = .002 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The effect on citation rates was less clear but followed the same trend .
Research findings/conclusions	"The only predictor of the 2015 citation rate was downloads after blogging ( r = 0.450 , p = .012 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	These preliminary results suggest that promotion of academic articles via social media may enhance download and citation rate and that this has implications for impact strategies .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In contrast to the no-decay assumption in the traditional approach , this study proposes a novel technique by assuming that the strength of knowledge decays when knowledge contained in one document is passed on to another document down the citation chain ."
Research method	"We propose three decay models , arithmetic decay , geometric decay , and harmonic decay , along with their theoretical properties ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In general , results of the proposed decay models depend largely on the local structure of a citation network as opposed to the global structure in the traditional approach ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Thus , the significance of citation links and the associated documents that are overemphasized by the global structure in the traditional no-decay approach is treated more properly ."
Research questions	"For example , the traditional approach commonly assigns high value to documents that heavily reference others , such as review articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically in the geometric and harmonic decay models , only truly significant review articles will be included in the resulting main paths ."
Research method	We demonstrate this new approach and its properties through the DNA literature citation network .
Research method	"Here , we use the stochastic publication/citation model of Q.L ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Burrell ( 2007 ) to show that the result might in fact be expected .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This brief communication is in the spirit of Q.L .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Burrell ( 2002 , 2005 ) , showing that results that might at first sight seem to be surprising can in fact often be explainable in a stochastic framework ."
Research questions	"To fill this gap , we explore the populations of academics who engage in social activities using an ASNS ; as an indicator of further engagement , we also determine their various motivations for joining a group in ASNSs ."
Research method	"Using groups and their members in Mendeley as the platform for our case study , we obtained 146 participant responses from our online survey about users ' common activities , usage habits , and motivations for joining groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that ( a ) participants did not engage with social-based features as frequently and actively as they engaged with research-based features , and ( b ) users who joined more groups seemed to have a stronger motivation to increase their professional visibility and to contribute the research articles that they had read to the group reading list ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results generate interesting insights into Mendeley 's user populations , their activities , and their motivations relative to the social features of Mendeley ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also argue that further design of ASNSs is needed to take greater account of disciplinary differences in scholarly communication and to establish incentive mechanisms for encouraging user participation .
Research method	"The units of analysis under study can be compared statistically across the 10,000+ journals ."
Research method	The interdisciplinarity of the portfolios is measured using Rao-Stirling diversity or Zhang etal .
Research findings/conclusions	's improved measure D-2 ( 3 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"At the country level we find regional differentiation ( e.g. , Latin American or Asian countries ) , but also a major divide between advanced and less-developed countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Israel and Israeli cities outperform other nations and cities in terms of diversity .
Research findings/conclusions	Universities appear to be specifically related to firms when a number of these units are exploratively compared .
Research findings/conclusions	"The instrument is relatively simple and straightforward , and one can generalize the application to any document set retrieved from the Web of Science ( WoS ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Further instruction is provided online at .
Research questions	"Because stories are constituted through narrative experience , and audiences are partly constitutive of the stories told to and with them , storytelling offers a framework for researching collective experiences of information ."
Research questions	"Stories are simultaneously empirical and socially constructed , bridging a key epistemological divide in IS ."
Research method	"Storytelling as paradigm shift is explored and demonstrated in three sections that ( a ) define story and storytelling , ( b ) describe how story and storytelling can extend the data , information , knowledge , and wisdom ( DIKW ) pyramid , and ( c ) revise DIKW as a new storytelling S-DIKW framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Future IS storytelling research should account for story and the dynamics of storytelling not merely as a subset of information or of information behavior , but as a fundamental information form ."
Research questions	"We argue information science research should integrate the social paradigm , as offered by social informatics , with affective and emotional considerations : a socio-emotional paradigm ."
Research method	A review of existing literature and Research findings/conclusions from users ' motivations to participate on the Academia section of the Stack Exchange social questioning-and-answering site make our case .
Research findings/conclusions	"We uncovered tensions between the intended information-centric focus of the community and users who believed social , emotional , and affective considerations needed to be foregrounded , speaking to online communities acting as boundary objects , with the fit for one user or community not always the same as for another ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"An integrated socio-emotional paradigm shows much strength for social informatics and information science research , including uncovering hidden concerns and differences in values , as in our study ."
Research questions	"Affective and emotional research , often bubbling under in information science , should rise to the surface is not so much a paradigm shift but an integration of social , emotional , and affective considerations into a socio-emotional paradigm ."
Research method	The supervised machine-learning model is applied with 11 features .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , our learner performs very well , with the F1 values of between 0.74 and 0.82 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Three features in particular , link-based Jaccard coefficient , difference in betweenness centrality , and cosine similarity of term frequency-inverse document frequency vectors , largely affect the predictions of citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results also indicate that different models are required for different types of research areas-research fields with a single issue or research fields with multiple issues .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the case of research fields with multiple issues , there are barriers among research fields because our results indicate that papers tend to be cited in each research field locally ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , one must consider the typology of targeted research areas when building models for link prediction in citation networks ."
Research method	We use a modification of the WEBSOM algorithm to create a user model based on a self-organizing network trained using a collection of documents representative of the person 's interests .
Research method	We introduce the concepts of freshness and coverage .
Research value/outlook/limitations	A document is fresh if it belongs to a semantic area of interest to a person for which no documents were seen in the recent past ; a group of documents has coverage to the extent to which it is a good representation of all the interests of a person .
Research findings/conclusions	Our tests show that these algorithms can effectively increase the coverage of the documents that are shown to the user without overly affecting precision .
Research findings/conclusions	It finds that he violated the norms of this theory by extremely truncating his data on the right .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also proves that Lotka himself played an important role in establishing the commonly used method of identifying power-law behavior by the R-2 fit to a regression line on a log-log plot that modern theory considers unreliable by basing the derivation of his law on this very method .
Research findings/conclusions	The data released are identified as open government data and the creation of open data portals supports their commitment through open government policies .
Research findings/conclusions	The worldwide increase of the open data publication is making more necessary the modelling of its impact on society .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research analyses the process of open data publication starting in the internal systems of the organization and reaching the actual reuse of data in reuser 's ecosystem surrounding the open data portals .
Research findings/conclusions	Different reuser 's profiles are identified and described within the reuser 's ecosystem .
Research method	Some key elements of the publication process are presented in order to guarantee sustainability of open data initiatives and to further analyse the social and economic impact .
Research questions	"Previous studies on the linkages mainly focus on the analysis of nonpatent references on the front page of patents , or the resulting citation-link networks , but with unsatisfactory performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the meanwhile , abundant mentioned entities in the scholarly articles and patents further complicate topic linkages ."
Research method	"To deal with this situation , a novel statistical entity-topic model ( named the CCorrLDA2 model ) , armed with the collapsed Gibbs sampling inference algorithm , is proposed to discover the hidden topics respectively from the academic articles and patents ."
Research method	"In order to reduce the negative impact on topic similarity calculation , word tokens and entity mentions are grouped by the Brown clustering method ."
Research method	Then a topic linkages construction problem is transformed into the well-known optimal transportation problem after topic similarity is calculated on the basis of symmetrized Kullback-Leibler ( KL ) divergence .
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach is feasible to build topic linkages with more superior performance than the counterparts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article clarifies whether faceted search improves the interactions between searchers and library catalogs and sheds light on ways that facets are used during a library search .
Research method	"To study searchers ' behaviors in natural situations , we collected from the servers a data set with more than 1.5 million useful search logs ."
Research method	"Logs were parsed , statistically analyzed , and manually studied using visualization tools to gain a general understanding of how facets are used in the search process ."
Research method	"A user experiment with 24 subjects was conducted to further understand contextual information , such as the searchers ' motivations and perceptions ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that most searchers were able to understand the concept of facets naturally and easily .
Research findings/conclusions	The faceted search was not able to shorten the search time but was able to improve the search accuracy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Facets were used more for open-ended tasks and difficult tasks that require more effort to learn , investigate , and explore ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results weaved a detailed story about the ways that people use facets and the ways that facets help people use library catalogs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	To share this data is important for reasons of both transparency and reuse .
Research questions	"Science , Technology , and Medicine journals have a role in facilitating sharing , but by what mechanism is not yet clear ."
Research method	The Journal Research Data ( JoRD ) Project was a JISC ( Joint Information Systems Committee ) -funded feasibility study on the potential for a central service on journal research data policies .
Research questions	The objectives of the study included identifying the current state of journal data sharing policies and investigating stakeholders ' views and practices .
Research findings/conclusions	The project confirmed that a large percentage of journals have no data sharing policy and that there are inconsistencies between those that are traceable .
Research findings/conclusions	This state leaves authors unsure of whether they should share article related data and where and how to deposit those data .
Research method	"In the absence of a consolidated infrastructure to share data easily , a model journal data sharing policy was developed by comparing quantitative information from analyzing existing journal data policies with qualitative data collected from stakeholders ."
Research method	This article summarizes and outlines the process by which the model was developed and presents the model journal data sharing policy .
Research method	"This article investigates the influence of time on the number of Mendeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of , and citations to , 4 general library and information science ( LIS ) journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For this discipline , it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many Scopus citations as Mendeley readers , and after this the Spearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years ."
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests that Mendeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"The lack of dates for individual Mendeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year , however , before making any comparisons between articles published in different years ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous studies on the digital divide were unable to capture the detected trends appropriately , because they worked with proxies , such as the number of subscriptions or related investments , without considering the vast heterogeneity in informational performance among technological devices ."
Research method	"We created a comprehensive data set ( based on over 1,100 sources ) that allows measuring information capacity directly , in bits per second , bits , and instructions per second ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The newly proposed indicators provide insights into inequalities in access to , usage of , and impact of digitized information flows ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It shows that the digital divide has gone into a second stage , which is based on a relative universalization of technological devices and a continuously evolving divide in terms of communication capacity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Recently , methods that exploit named entities have been shown to be more effective for query expansion than traditional pseudorelevance feedback methods ."
Research method	"In this article , we introduce a supervised learning approach that exploits named entities for query expansion using Wikipedia as a repository of high-quality feedback documents ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In contrast with existing entity-oriented pseudorelevance feedback approaches , we tackle query expansion as a learning-to-rank problem ."
Research method	"As a result , not only do we select effective expansion terms but we also weigh these terms according to their predicted effectiveness ."
Research method	"To this end , we exploit the rich structure of Wikipedia articles to devise discriminative term features , including each candidate term 's proximity to the original query terms , as well as its frequency across multiple article fields and in category and infobox descriptors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments on three Text REtrieval Conference web test collections attest the effectiveness of our approach , with gains of up to 23.32 % in terms of mean average precision , 19.49 % in terms of precision at 10 , and 7.86 % in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain compared with a state-of-the-art approach for entity-oriented query expansion ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Instead , there is a need to harness the collective IT resources of the diverse stakeholders operating in the interorganizational business networks that characterize the contemporary business landscape ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This , in turn , demands an appropriate leadership structure ."
Research questions	"However , the notion of green leadership has not received adequate research attention to date ."
Research questions	"Using a case study of green IT implementation at China Mobile , the world 's largest mobile telecommunications provider , this study seeks to shed light on the underlying process through which green leadership is achieved and subsequently enacted to facilitate collective green IT initiatives ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"With its Research findings/conclusions , this study presents a process theory that complements the dominant , internally-oriented perspective of green IT and provides practitioners with a useful reference for leveraging the collective IT resources of their network partners to contribute toward preserving the environment for future generations ."
Research method	We compare ( a ) normalization by counting citations in proportion to the length of the reference list ( 1/N of references ) with ( b ) rescaling by dividing citation scores by the arithmetic mean of the citation rate of the cluster .
Research method	"Rescaling is analytical and therefore independent of the quality of the attribution to the sets , whereas fractional counting provides an empirical strategy for normalization among sets ( by evaluating the between-group variance ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By the fairness test of Radicchi and Castellano ( 2012a ) , rescaling outperforms fractional counting of citations for reasons that we consider ."
Research questions	"This study aimed to bridge the gap by exploring i ) the relationship between task complexity and difficulty ; ii ) factors affecting task difficulty ; and iii ) the relationship between task difficulty , task complexity , and user search behaviors in MIR ."
Research method	An empirical user experiment was conducted with 51 participants and a novel MIR system .
Research method	The participants searched for 6 topics across 3 complexity levels .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results revealed that i ) perceived task difficulty in music search is influenced by task complexity , user background , system affordances , and task uncertainty and enjoyability ; and ii ) perceived task difficulty in MIR is significantly correlated with effectiveness metrics such as the number of songs found , number of clicks , and task completion time ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions have implications for the design of music search tasks ( in research ) or use cases ( in system development ) as well as future MIR systems that can detect task difficulty based on user effectiveness metrics .
Research questions	"Within the broad context of data citation , we focus on the automatic construction of citations problem for hierarchically structured data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We present the learning to cite framework , which enables the automatic construction of human- and machine-readable citations with different levels of coarseness ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main goal is to reduce the human intervention on data to a minimum and to provide a citation system general enough to work on heterogeneous and complex XML data sets .
Research findings/conclusions	"We describe how this framework can be realized by a system for creating citations to single nodes within an XML data set and , as a use case , show how it can be applied in the context of digital archives ."
Research method	"We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed citation system by analyzing its effectiveness from the correctness and completeness viewpoints , showing that it represents a suitable solution that can be easily employed in real-world environments and that reduces human intervention on data to a minimum ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose that the nature of the knowledge shared and an individual 's social network influence employees to find more value in person-to-person knowledge sharing , which could lead them to bypass the codified knowledge provided by a knowledge management system ( KMS ) ."
Research method	We surveyed employees of a workman 's compensation board in Canada and used social network analysis and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the data .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that knowledge complexity and knowledge teachability increased the likelihood of finding value in person-to-person knowledge transfer , but knowledge observability did not ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Contrary to expectations , whether the knowledge was available in the KMS had no impact on the value of person-to-person knowledge transfer ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In terms of the social network , individuals with larger networks tended to perceive more value in the person-to-person transfer of knowledge than those with smaller networks ."
Research questions	"More recently , the same authors ( Egghe & Rousseau , 2012b ) have presented a new ( implicit ) formula based on the so-called shifted Lotka function to allow for the objection that the original model makes no allowance for papers receiving zero citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Here it is shown , through a small empirical study , that the formulae actually give very similar results whether or not the uncited papers are included ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , and more important , it is found that they both seriously underestimate the true h-index , and we suggest that the reason for this is that this is a contextthe citation distribution of an author-in which straightforward Lotkaian informetrics is inappropriate ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Indeed , the analysis suggests that even if we restrict attention to the upper tail of the citation distribution , a simple Lotka/Pareto-like model can give misleading results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , the differential impacts of such social influence on developers ' initial and sustained participation behaviors were largely overlooked in previous research ."
Research method	"We empirically studied the impacts of two social influence mechanisms-word-of-mouth ( WOM ) and observational learning ( OL ) -on these two types of participation , using data collected from a large OSS development platform called Open Hub ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that action ( OL ) speaks louder than words ( WOM ) with regard to sustained participation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , project age positively moderates the impacts of social influence on both types of participation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For projects with a higher average workload , the impacts of OL are reduced on initial participation but are increased on sustained participation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our study provides a better understanding of how social influence affects OSS developers ' participation behaviors .
Research findings/conclusions	It also offers important practical implications for designing software development platforms that can leverage social influence to attract more initial and sustained participation .
Research questions	"General methodologies , best practice , and guidelines for web information architecture ( IA ) have been developed and refined ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research paper extends the knowledge base for web IA by examining situated practice within large organizations and building theory to provide a deeper understanding of how large organizations construct information-rich websites .
Research method	"A grounded theory , The Situated Practice of Web IA in Large Organizations , is proposed as an integrated theoretical framework for practice in this context ."
Research method	"The theoretical framework is composed of 4 foundational constructs titled : owning , negotiating , enacting , and knowing web IA ."
Research questions	"Building on these foundations , an integrating central construct of practicing web IA is proposed ."
Research findings/conclusions	This theoretical framework will inform large organizations and practitioners as they approach web IA .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Such scholarship promotes reuse of digital data , provokes new research questions , and cultivates new audiences ."
Research questions	"Digital curation , the process of managing a trusted body of information for current and future use , helps maximize the value of research in digital humanities ."
Research method	"Predicated on semistructured interviews , this naturalistic case study explores the creation , use , storage , and planned reuse of data by 45 interviewees involved with 19 Office of Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant ( SUG ) projects ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Interviewees grappled with challenges surrounding data , collaboration and communication , planning and project management , awareness and outreach , resources , and technology ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Overall this study explores the existing digital curation practices and needs of scholars engaged in innovative digital humanities work and to discern how closely these practices and needs align with the digital curation literature .
Research questions	The trade-off users have to make between using sites such as Facebook to connect with their friends versus protecting their personal privacy is not well understood .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , very little behavioral research has focused on how personal privacy concerns are related to information disclosures made by one 's friends ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our survey study of 116 Facebook users shows that engaging with friends through tagging activity and third-party application use is associated with higher levels of personal Facebook usage and a stronger emotional attachment to Facebook .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , users who have high levels of personal privacy concern and perceive a lack of effectiveness in Facebook 's privacy policies tend to engage less frequently in tagging and app activities with friends , respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our model and results explore illustrate the complexity of the trade-off between privacy concerns , engaging with friends through tagging and apps , and Facebook usage ."
Research questions	"However , existing search systems often fail to provide users with a good list of medical search results , especially for classic ( keyword-based ) queries ."
Research questions	In this article we elaborate on whether and how we can exploit biomedicine-related entities from the emerging Web of Data for improving ( through reranking ) the results returned by a search system .
Research questions	The aim is to promote relevant but low-ranked hits containing entities that are important to the current search context .
Research method	"We introduce an approach that is based on entity extraction applied on the retrieved documents , yielding a graph of documents along with entities , which in turn is analyzed probabilistically using a Random Walk-based method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed approach is independent of the submitted query and the underlying retrieval models , and thus can be applied over any ranked list of medical search results ."
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results using the data set of TREC Clinical Decision Support track demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the results returned by classic and widely applicable retrieval models .
Research findings/conclusions	The results also enabled us to identify cases where the proposed reranking method fails to improve the ranking .
Research findings/conclusions	There is a huge semantic gap between different modalities on account of heterogeneous properties .
Research questions	How to establish the correlation among different modality data faces enormous challenges .
Research questions	"In this work , we propose a novel end-to-end framework named Dual Multi-Angle Self-Attention ( DMASA ) for cross-modal retrieval ."
Research method	Multiple self-attention mechanisms are applied to extract fine-grained features for both images and texts from different angles .
Research method	"We then integrate coarse-grained and fine-grained features into a multimodal embedding space , in which the similarity degrees between images and texts can be directly compared ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we propose a special multistage training strategy , in which the preceding stage can provide a good initial value for the succeeding stage and make our framework work better ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Very promising experimental results over the state-of-the-art methods can be achieved on three benchmark datasets ofFlickr8k , Flickr30k , andMSCOCO ."
Research questions	The aim of this task is to classify opinions as positive or negative .
Research method	There are two main approaches to carrying out polarity classification : machine learning and semantic orientation based on the integration of knowledge resources .
Research questions	"In this study , we propose to combine both approaches using a voting system based on the majority rule ."
Research questions	"In this way , we attempt to improve the polarity classification of two parallel corpora such as the opinion corpus for Arabic ( OCA ) and the English version of the OCA ( EVOCA ) ."
Research method	Several experiments have been performed to check the feasibility of the proposed method .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the experiment that took into account both approaches in the voting system obtained the best performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , it is also shown that the proposed method slightly improves the best results obtained using machine learning approaches solely over the OCA and the EVOCA separately ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , we can conclude that the approach proposed here might be considered a good strategy for polarity detection when we work with bilingual parallel corpora ."
Research findings/conclusions	A series of reasons have been highlighted in previous studies .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research explores another possibilitywhether there is a clubbing effect in China 's surge in research citations , in which a higher rate of internal citing takes place among influential Chinese researchers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Focusing on the most highly cited research articles in nanotechnology , we find that a larger proportion of Chinese nanotechnology research citations are localized within individual , institutional , and national networks within China ."
Research findings/conclusions	Both descriptive and statistical tests suggest that highly cited Chinese papers are more likely than similar U.S. papers to receive internal and localized citations .
Research findings/conclusions	Tentative explanations and policy implications are discussed .
Research method	The result was a productivity distribution described by a power law .
Research method	"In this paper , Lotka 's original data on author productivity in chemistry are reconsidered ."
Research method	"We define a discrete power law with exponential cutoff , test Lotka 's data , and compare the fit to the discrete power law ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Research examining how data papers report data events , such as data transactions and manipulations , is limited ."
Research method	The research reported on in this article addresses this limitation and investigated how data events are inscribed in data papers .
Research method	"A content analysis was conducted examining the full texts of 82 data papers , drawn from the curated list of data papers connected to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ."
Research method	Data events recorded for each paper were organized into a set of 17 categories .
Research findings/conclusions	"Many of these categories are described together in the same sentence , which indicates the messiness of data events in the laboratory space ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions challenge the degrees to which data papers are a distinct genre compared to research articles and they describe data-centric research processes in a through way .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article also discusses how our results could inform a better data publication ecosystem in the future .
Research method	We conducted an experiment to test a comprehensive model of user experience with news sites that was developed previously by means of an online survey .
Research method	Level of adoption ( novel or adopted site ) was controlled with a between-subjects manipulation .
Research method	We collected participants ' answers to psychometric scales at 2 times : after presentation of 5 screenshots of a news site and directly after 10 minutes of hands-on experience with the site .
Research method	The model was extended with the prediction of users ' satisfaction with news sites as a high-level design goal .
Research method	A psychometric measure of trust in news providers was developed and added to the model to better predict people 's intention to use particular news sites .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The model presented in this article represents a theoretically founded , empirically tested basis for evaluating news websites , and it holds theoretical relevance to user-experience research in general ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , the Research findings/conclusions and the model are applied to provide practical guidance in design prioritization ."
Research method	We compare author citation ranking and cocitation mapping results in the stem cell research field from 2004 to 2009 using two AND approaches : the traditional simplified approach of using author surname and first initial and a sophisticated algorithmic approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the traditional approach leads to extremely distorted rankings and substantially distorted mappings of authors in this field when based on first- or all-author citation counting , whereas last-author-based citation ranking and cocitation mapping both appear relatively immune to the author name ambiguity problem ."
Research questions	"This is largely because Romanized names of Chinese and Korean authors , who are very active in this field , are extremely ambiguous , but few of these researchers consistently publish as last authors in bylines ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that a more earnest effort is required to deal with the author name ambiguity problem in both citation analysis and information retrieval , especially given the current trend toward globalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the stem cell research field , in which laboratory heads are traditionally listed as last authors in bylines , last-author-based citation ranking and cocitation mapping using the traditional approach to author name disambiguation may serve as a simple workaround , but likely at the price of largely filtering out Chinese and Korean contributions to the field as well as important contributions by young researchers ."
Research questions	The objective of the evaluation was to detect deficiencies in the taxonomy and to infer problems of applied construction steps from users ' navigation difficulties .
Research method	The evaluation approach included scenario-based navigation exercises and postexercise interviews .
Research method	Navigation exercise errors and underlying reasons were analyzed in relation to specific components of the taxonomy and applied construction steps .
Research findings/conclusions	Guidelines for the construction of the hierarchical structure and categories of an organizational taxonomy using existing general classification schemes and domain thesauri were derived from the evaluation results .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents the framework and a thorough evaluation of each of its components .
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results on a large data set of 18 mood categories show that combining lyrics and audio significantly outperformed systems using audio-only features .
Research findings/conclusions	Automatic feature selection techniques were further proved to have reduced feature space .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the examination of learning curves shows that the hybrid systems using lyrics and audio needed fewer training samples and shorter audio clips to achieve the same or better classification accuracies than systems using lyrics or audio singularly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Last but not least , performance comparisons reveal the relative importance of audio and lyric features across mood categories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In some domains , the existence of less content in the users ' native language may not be problematic and even help to cope with the information overload ."
Research questions	"Yet , in domains such as health , where information quality is critical , a larger quantity of information may mean easier access to higher quality content ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Query translation may be a good strategy to access content in other languages , but the presence of medical terms in health queries makes the translation process more difficult , even for users with very good language proficiencies ."
Research questions	"In this study , we evaluate how translating a health query affects users with different language proficiencies ."
Research method	We chose English as the non-native language because it is a widely spoken language and it is the most used language on the web .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that non-English-speaking users having at least elementary English proficiency can benefit from a system that suggests English alternatives for their queries , or automatically retrieves English content from a non-English query ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This awareness of the user profile results in higher precision , more accurate medical knowledge , and better access to high-quality content ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the suggestions of English-translated queries may also trigger new health search strategies ."
Research method	"First , approximate string matching methods were used to generate lists of index words most similar to contemporary query terms in a digitized newspaper collection from the 1800s ."
Research method	Top index word variants were categorized to estimate the appropriate query expansion ranges in the retrieval test .
Research method	"Second , the effectiveness of approximate string matching methods , automatically generated inflectional forms , and their combinations were measured in a Cranfield-style test ."
Research method	"Finally , a detailed topic-level analysis of test results was conducted ."
Research findings/conclusions	In the index of historical newspaper collection the occurrences of a word typically spread to many linguistic and historical variants along with optical character recognition ( OCR ) errors .
Research findings/conclusions	All query expansion methods improved the baseline results .
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive expansion of around 30 variants for each query word was required to achieve the highest performance improvement .
Research findings/conclusions	"Query expansion based on approximate string matching was superior to using the inflectional forms of the query words , showing that coverage of the different types of variation is more important than precision in handling one type of variation ."
Research questions	Measuring the Semantic Similarity ( SS ) with higher accuracy is a challenging task .
Research questions	"In this context , the Information Content ( IC ) -based SS measure has gained popularity over the others ."
Research questions	The notion of IC evolves from the science of information theory .
Research questions	Information theory has very high potential to characterize the semantics of concepts .
Research method	"Designing an IC-based SS framework comprises ( i ) an IC calculator , and ( ii ) an SS calculator ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a generic intrinsic IC-based SS calculator ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We also introduce here a new structural aspect of an ontology called DCS ( Disjoint Common Subsumers ) that plays a significant role in deciding the similarity between two concepts .
Research method	"We evaluated our proposed similarity calculator with the existing intrinsic IC-based similarity calculators , as well as corpora-dependent similarity calculators using several benchmark data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the proposed similarity calculator produces a high correlation with human evaluation over the existing state-of-the-art IC-based similarity calculators .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although the individual influences of these attributes on the structure and function of a network have been analyzed in detail , a more accurate picture emerges in proper perspective and context only when research methods are employed to integrate their collective impacts on the network ."
Research method	"In a major research project , we have undertaken this examination ."
Research method	"This paper presents an extract from this project , using a global network assessment of these characteristics ."
Research method	"We apply our methods to analyze the collaboration networks of a subset of researchers in India through their coauthored papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in management science , including related areas of information technology and economics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find the Indian networks to be currently suffering from a high degree of fragmentation , which severely restricts researchers ' long-rage connectivities in the networks ."
Research method	Comparisons are made with networks of a similar sample of researchers working in the United States .
Research method	"By using information retrieval and metasearch methodologies , different types of referential metadata ( related Wikipedia pages , data sets , source code , video lectures , presentation slides , and online tutorials ) for an assortment of publications and scientific topics will be automatically retrieved , associated , and ranked ( via the language model and the inference network model ) to provide easily understandable cyberlearning resources to answer students ' questions ."
Research method	We also designed an experimental system to automatically answer students ' questions for a specific academic publication and then evaluated the quality of the answers ( the recommended resources ) using mean reciprocal rank and normalized discounted cumulative gain .
Research findings/conclusions	"After examining preliminary evaluation results and student feedback , we found that cyberlearning resources can provide high-quality and straightforward answers for students ' and scholars ' questions concerning the content of academic publications ."
Research questions	When studying technology and innovation through patent analysis it is well known that similar amounts of technological knowledge can produce different numbers of patented innovation as output .
Research value/outlook/limitations	A new multilayered approach to measure the technological value of patents based on ego patent citation networks ( PCNs ) is developed in this study .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the structural indicators for the ego PCN developed in this contribution can characterize groups of patents and , hence , in an indirect way , the health of companies ."
Research questions	Its accomplishments in this regard have made it a point of inquiry for researchers from different fields of knowledge .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A decade of research has thrown light on many aspects of the Wikipedia community , its processes , and its content ."
Research questions	"However , due to the variety of fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the limited synthesis of the extensive research , there is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia 's content as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge ."
Research method	"This study addresses the issue by systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed publications on Wikipedia content , summarizing the current Research findings/conclusions , and highlighting the major research trends ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Two major streams of research are identified : the quality of Wikipedia content ( including comprehensiveness , currency , readability , and reliability ) and the size of Wikipedia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we present the key research trends in terms of the domains of inquiry , research design , data source , and data gathering methods ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This review synthesizes scholarly understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way for future studies .
Research method	The paper reviews and extends existing sensemaking models with ideas from learning and cognition .
Research method	"It reviews literature on sensemaking models in human-computer interaction ( HCI ) , cognitive system engineering , organizational communication , and library and information sciences ( LIS ) , learning theories , cognitive psychology , and task-based information seeking ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The model resulting from this synthesis moves to a stronger basis for explaining sensemaking behaviors and conceptual changes .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The model illustrates the iterative processes of sensemaking , extends existing models that focus on activities by integrating cognitive mechanisms and the creation of instantiated structure elements of knowledge , and different types of conceptual change to show a complete picture of the cognitive processes of sensemaking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The processes and cognitive mechanisms identified provide better foundations for knowledge creation , organization , and sharing practices and a stronger basis for design of sensemaking assistant systems and tools ."
Research questions	"Traditionally , impact has been measured by citations ; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs like sound recordings ."
Research findings/conclusions	Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact .
Research findings/conclusions	Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines .
Research method	"This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives : British Library Sounds , Europeana Sounds , the Internet Archive Audio Archive , PennSound , and UbuWeb ."
Research method	"By using text analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends , and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources , this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the limitations of using social media data , the evidence gathered in this case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound collections , and may point to future priorities for the digital preservation of sound ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Besides reporting usual bibliographic indicators , we investigated the human cornerstone of any peer-reviewed journal : its editorial board ."
Research method	"Demographic data about the 2,846 gatekeepers serving in information systems ( IS ) editorial boards were collected ."
Research method	We discuss various scientometric indicators supported by descriptive statistics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions reflect the great variety of IS journals in terms of research output , author communities , editorial boards , and gatekeeper demographics ( e.g. , diversity in gender and location ) , seniority , authority , and degree of involvement in editorial boards ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We believe that these results may help the general public and scholars ( e.g. , readers , authors , journal gatekeepers , policy makers ) to revise and increase their knowledge of scholarly communication in the IS field ."
Research findings/conclusions	The EB_IS_2009 dataset supporting this scientometric study is released as online supplementary material to this article to foster further research on editorial boards .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Hence , studying how this sentiment emerges is important ."
Research questions	"In years past , this was straightforward , often dictated by journalists who cover financial news , but this has become more complex now ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we focus on how social media sentiment affects mass media sentiment ."
Research method	"Using data from Sina Weibo and Sina Finance ( around 60 million weibos and 6.2 million news articles ) , we show that social media does influence mass media sentiment emergence for financial news ."
Research findings/conclusions	The sentiment consistency between social media reaction and prior news articles amplifies the persistence of mass media sentiment over time .
Research findings/conclusions	"By contrast , we found limited evidence of social media reducing the persistence of mass media sentiment over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results have significant implications for understanding how 2 types of media , treated separately in the literature , may be connected ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When updated regularly , it shows the current scientific performance of researchers rather than their lifetime achievement as indicated by common scientometric indicators ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this respect , the new rating scheme resembles established sports ratings such as in chess or tennis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By the example of ACM SIGMOD E.F. Codd Innovations Award winners and Priestley Medal recipients , we illustrate how the new rating can be represented by a single number and visualized ."
Research findings/conclusions	This base map enables users to overlay downloads from Scopus interactively .
Research method	"Using a single year ( e.g. , 2012 ) , results can be compared with mappings based on the Journal Citation Reports at the Web of Science ( N=10,936 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Scopus maps are more detailed at both the local and global levels because of their greater coverage , including , for example , the arts and humanities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The base maps can be interactively overlaid with journal distributions in sets downloaded from Scopus , for example , for the Research questions of portfolio analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	Rao-Stirling diversity can be used as a measure of interdisciplinarity in the sets under study .
Research findings/conclusions	"Maps at the global and the local level , however , can be very different because of the different levels of aggregation involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Two journals , for example , can both belong to the humanities in the global map , but participate in different specialty structures locally ."
Research findings/conclusions	The base map and interactive tools are available online ( with instructions ) at http : //www.leydesdorff.net/scopus_ovl .
Research method	"We develop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and associated perspectives on technological emergence across geographical , social , and cognitive spaces ."
Research method	"To do so , we longitudinally analyze ( with publication and patent data ) three case studies of emerging technologies in the medical domain ."
Research questions	"These are RNA interference ( RNAi ) , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing technologies for cervical cancer , and thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) genetic testing ."
Research questions	"Given the flexibility ( i.e. , adaptability to different sources of data ) and granularity ( i.e. , applicability across multiple levels of data aggregation ) of overlay mapping techniques , we argue that these techniques can favor the integration and comparison of results from different contexts and cases , thus potentially functioning as a platform for distributed strategic intelligence for analysts and decision makers ."
Research questions	It is shown that several factors contribute to the overall energy and environmental costs of information and communication technology ( ICT ) in general and digital information systems and services in particular .
Research findings/conclusions	It is also shown that end-user energy costs play a key role in the overall environmental costs of a digital library or information service .
Research questions	"It is argued that appropriate user research , transaction log analysis , user modeling , and better design and delivery of services can significantly reduce the user interaction time , and thus the environmental costs , of digital information systems and services , making them more sustainable ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using textual analyses we provide a classification of emotions within posts across three main themes of interaction emotions , response emotions , and preoccupation emotions and show that many requests for information by young first-time mothers are motivated by negative emotions ."
Research findings/conclusions	This has implications for how moderators of online news groups respond to online request for help and for understanding how to support vulnerable young parents .
Research questions	"In order to engage with these emergent realities , understanding who people are in terms of their social identities , social power , and as epistemic agents-that is , knowers , speakers , listeners , and informants-may provide insight into human information interactions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These are matters of epistemic injustice .
Research questions	"Drawing heavily from Miranda Fricker 's work Epistemic Injustice : Power & the Ethics of Knowing , I use the concept of epistemic injustice ( testimonial , systematic , and hermeneutical injustice ) to consider people as epistemic beings rather than users in order to potentially illuminate new understandings of the subfields of information behavior and information literacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Focusing on people as knowers , speakers , listeners , and informants rather than users presents an opportunity for information researchers , practitioners , and LIS educators to work in service of the epistemic interests of people and in alignment with liberatory aims ."
Research questions	"In this research , we present the results of experiments designed to evaluate the performance of a real-time interest model ( RIM ) that attempts to identify the dynamic and changing query level interests regarding social media outputs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike most existing ranking methods , our ranking approach targets calculation of the probability that user interest in the content of the document is subject to very dynamic user interest change ."
Research method	We describe 2 formulations of the model ( real-time interest vector space and real-time interest language model ) stemming from classical relevance ranking methods and develop a novel methodology for evaluating the performance of RIM using Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect ( interest-based ) relevance judgments on a daily basis .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that the model usually , although not always , performs better than baseline results obtained from commercial web search engines ."
Research findings/conclusions	We identify factors that affect RIM performance and outline plans for future research .
Research method	"Here we identify the 250 most heavily used journals in each of 26 research fields ( 4,721 journals , 19.4M articles ) indexed by the Scopus database , and test whether topic , academic status , and accessibility make articles from these journals more or less likely to be referenced on Wikipedia ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that a journal 's academic status ( impact factor ) and accessibility ( open access policy ) both strongly increase the probability of it being referenced on Wikipedia .
Research findings/conclusions	"Controlling for field and impact factor , the odds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47 % higher compared to paywall journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions provide evidence is that a major consequence of open access policies is to significantly amplify the diffusion of science , through an intermediary like Wikipedia , to a broad audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Identifying the sentiment present in them can be helpful for measuring the frame of mind of the public , their satisfaction with respect to a product , or their support of a social event ."
Research questions	"In this context , polarity classification is a subfield of sentiment analysis focused on determining whether the content of a text is objective or subjective , and in the latter case , if it conveys a positive or a negative opinion ."
Research questions	"Most polarity detection techniques tend to take into account individual terms in the text and even some degree of linguistic knowledge , but they do not usually consider syntactic relations between words ."
Research questions	"This article explores how relating lexical , syntactic , and psychometric information can be helpful to perform polarity classification on Spanish tweets ."
Research method	We provide an evaluation for both shallow and deep linguistic perspectives .
Research findings/conclusions	"Empirical results show an improved performance of syntactic approaches over pure lexical models when using large training sets to create a classifier , but this tendency is reversed when small training collections are used ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In particular , literature on the emergence of collective intelligence in social tagging systems has increased ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a probabilistic generative model to detect latent topical communities among users ."
Research method	Social tags and resource contents are leveraged to model user interest in two similar and correlated ways .
Research questions	Our primary goal is to capture user tagging behavior and interest and discover the emergent topical community structure .
Research findings/conclusions	"The communities should be groups of users with frequent social interactions as well as similar topical interests , which would have important research implications for personalized information services ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results on two real social tagging data sets with different genres have shown that the proposed generative model more accurately models user interest and detects high-quality and meaningful topical communities .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although these criticisms have been noted , they have been largely brushed aside or ignored , not addressed head on ."
Research questions	"This may be for a number of reasons , but we believe the main one is that these criticisms undermine the desire to have an easy scientificthat is , quantitativemethod of evaluation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Consequently , we continue and update our criticism of the use of citations for evaluation ."
Research questions	Such tags can act as navigational cues that enable users to discover meaningful and relevant information in a Web 2.0 environment .
Research questions	"This is particularly critical for nonexperts for understanding formal academic or scientific resources , also known as hard content ."
Research questions	The goal of this study was to develop a novel one-bit comparison ( OBC ) metric and to assess in what circumstances a set of tags describing a hard-content resource is mature and representative .
Research method	We compared OBC with the conventional Shannon entropy approach to determine performance when distinguishing tags generated by domain experts and nonexperts in the early and later stages under social influence .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicated that OBC can accurately distinguish mature tags generated by a strong expert consensus from other tags , and outperform Shannon entropy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions support tag-based learning , and provide insights and tools for the design of applications involving tags , such as tag recommendation and tag-based organization ."
Research method	"During the experiment , participants were asked to search Google to obtain information on the two given search tasks ."
Research method	"Participants ' primary emotions were inferred from analysis of their facial expressions , data on secondary emotions were obtained through participant interviews , and mood was measured using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale ( PANAS ; Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) prior , during , and after the search ."
Research method	"The search process was represented by the collection of search actions , search performance , and search outcome quality variables ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest existence of direct relationships between primary emotions and search actions , which in turn imply the possibility of inferring emotions from search actions and vice versa ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The link between secondary emotions and searchers ' evaluative judgments , and lack of evidence of any relationships between secondary emotions and other search process variables , point to the strengths and weaknesses of self-reported emotion measures in understanding searchers ' affective experiences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our study did not find strong relationships between mood and search process and outcomes , indicating that while mood can have a limited effect on search activities , it is a relatively stable and long-lasting state that can not be easily altered by the search experience and , in turn , can not significantly affect the search ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The article proposes a model of relationships between emotions , mood , and several facets of the search process ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Directions for future work are also discussed .
Research method	The empirical data are taken from two online surveys of European authors .
Research method	"Taking a domain analytic approach , the analysis draws on Becher and Trowler 's ( 2001 ) and Whitley 's ( 2000 ) theories to gain a deeper understanding of why OA repositories ( OAR ) play a particularly important role in the chosen disciplines ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The surveys provided a unique opportunity to compare perceptions , motivations , and behaviors of researchers at the discipline level with the parent metadiscipline ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It should be noted that participants were not drawn from a stratified sample of all the different subdisciplines that constitute each discipline , and therefore the generalizability of the Research findings/conclusions to the discipline may be limited ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The differential role of informal and formal communication in each of the three disciplines has shaped green OA practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"For physicists and economists , preprints are an essential feature of their respective OAR landscapes , whereas for clinical medics final published articles have a central role ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In comparing the disciplines with their parent metadisciplines there were some notable similarities/differences , which have methodological implications for studying research cultures ."
Research method	A secondary analysis was carried out on three different data sets .
Research method	"They were ( a ) country-level data on ISU from World Values Survey ( 2005-2009 ) ; ( b ) country-specific mean scores of Hofstede 's national culture dimensions ( HNCD ) of individualism ( IDV ) , power distance ( PDI ) , time orientation , uncertainty avoidance ( UAI ) , masculinity ( MAS ) , and indulgence ( IVR ) ; and ( c ) measures of wealth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis showed the importance of three national culture dimensions of PDI ( the way people of a nation interact with authorities ) , IDV ( the degree of centrality of person or groups in a country ) , and IVR ( the agreeableness of joy and happiness in a country ) for explaining the cross-cultural differences of ISU ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions were explained through HNCD , and four cultural patterns of ISU were identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , further research is required to better understand the complex relationships of cultural factors , ISU , and other societal variables ."
Research method	The groups and intergroup relations can be analyzed and visualized using tools from network analysis .
Research method	"Using the so-called excellence indicator PPtop-10 % -the proportion of the top-10 % most-highly-cited papers assigned to a university-we pursue a classification using ( a ) overlapping stability intervals , ( b ) statistical-significance tests , and ( c ) effect sizes of differences among 902 universities in 54 countries ; we focus on the UK , Germany , Brazil , and the USA as national examples ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the groupings remain largely the same using different statistical significance levels or overlapping stability intervals , these classifications are uncorrelated with those based on effect sizes ."
Research findings/conclusions	Effect sizes for the differences between universities are small ( w < .2 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"The more detailed analysis of universities at the country level suggests that distinctions beyond three or perhaps four groups of universities ( high , middle , low ) may not be meaningful ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Given similar institutional incentives , isomorphism within each eco-system of universities should not be underestimated ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results suggest that networks based on overlapping stability intervals can provide a first impression of the relevant groupings among universities .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the clusters are not well-defined divisions between groups of universities ."
Research method	"Traditionally , the main methodologies employed for representing data are multidimensional scaling , principal component analysis , or correspondence analysis ."
Research questions	In this paper we aim to present a visualization methodology known as biplot analysis for representing bibliometric and science and technology indicators .
Research method	"A biplot is a graphical representation of multivariate data , where the elements of a data matrix are represented according to dots and vectors associated with the rows and columns of the matrix ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we explore the possibilities of applying biplot analysis in the research policy area ."
Research method	"More specifically , we first describe and introduce the reader to this methodology and secondly , we analyze its strengths and weaknesses through 3 different case studies : countries , universities , and scientific fields ."
Research method	"For this , we use a biplot analysis known as JK-biplot ."
Research method	"Finally , we compare the biplot representation with other multivariate analysis techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that biplot analysis could be a useful technique in scientometrics when studying multivariate data , as well as an easy-to-read tool for research decision makers ."
Research method	"In a two-phase survey , we investigate scholars ' familiarity and usage of traditional metrics and altmetrics ."
Research method	"In this paper , we present the second phase with 448 participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found few traditional metrics , like the Journal Impact Factor and number of citations , are familiar to and often used by scholars for research evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among altmetrics , only views/downloads , readers , and followers are known to more than half the respondents ."
Research findings/conclusions	Unseen benefits and lack of time are hindrances to using metrics for the evaluation of research outputs .
Research questions	"Although social media are well-known , scholars prefer promoting their research by publishing in journals and attending conferences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found social media usage , perceived ease of use and usefulness of altmetrics affect the usage of altmetrics ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions suggest altmetrics have attracted attention in academia and could be considered complementary to traditional metrics .
Research findings/conclusions	"We acknowledge that due to the limited sample size , statistics and demographics in this study , Research findings/conclusions can not be said to be representative of the entire academic population worldwide ."
Research findings/conclusions	Future studies are needed that cover a wider range of academic disciplines around the world .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the number of yearly citations depends upon time for multiple reasons : a ) general time trends in citation data , b ) changing coverage of databases , c ) individual citation life-cycles , and d ) selection on citation impact ."
Research questions	"Hence , it is often ill-advised to simply compare the average number of citations before and after an event to estimate its causal effect ."
Research questions	"Using a recent publication in this journal on the potential citation chain reaction of a Nobel Prize , we demonstrate that a simple pre-post comparison can lead to biased and misleading results ."
Research findings/conclusions	We propose using matched control groups to improve causal inference and illustrate that the inclusion of a tailor-made synthetic control group in the statistical analysis helps to avoid methodological artifacts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results suggest that there is neither a Nobel Prize effect as regards citation impact of the Nobel laureate under investigation nor a related chain reaction in the citation network , as suggested in the original study ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we explain that these methodological recommendations extend far beyond the study of Nobel Prize effects in citation data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , such techniques work only for objects with previously assigned tags ."
Research questions	"Here we focus on tag recommendation for objects with no tags , a variation of the well-known \textit { cold start } problem ."
Research questions	We start by evaluating state-of-the-art co-occurrence based methods in cold start .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that the effectiveness of these methods suffers in this situation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we show that employing various automatic filtering strategies to generate an initial tag set that enables the use of co-occurrence patterns produces only marginal improvements ."
Research method	We then propose a new approach that exploits both positive and negative user feedback to iteratively select input tags along with a genetic programming strategy to learn the recommendation function .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our experimental results indicate that extending the methods to include user relevance feedback leads to gains in precision of up to 58 % over the best baseline in cold start scenarios and gains of up to 43 % over the best baseline in objects that contain some initial tags ( i.e. , no cold start ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also show that our best relevance-feedback-driven strategy performs well even in scenarios that lack user cooperation ( i.e. , users may refuse to provide feedback ) and user reliability ( i.e. , users may provide the wrong feedback ) ."
Research method	"In the similarity-oriented approach , an assessed article 's raw citation count is compared with a reference value that is derived from a reference set , which is constructed in such a way that articles in this set are estimated to address a subject matter similar to that of the assessed article ."
Research method	This estimation is based on second-order similarity and utilizes a combination of 2 feature sets : bibliographic references and technical terminology .
Research findings/conclusions	The contribution of an article in a given reference set to the reference value is dependent on its degree of similarity to the assessed article .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is shown that reference values calculated by the similarity-oriented approach are considerably better at predicting the assessed articles ' citation count compared to the reference values given by the journal-set approach , thus significantly reducing the variability in the observed citation distribution that stems from the variability in the articles ' addressed subject matter ."
Research questions	"They often influence , reflect , and reinforce gender stereotypes , including those that represent occupations ."
Research questions	This study examines the prevalence of gender stereotypes on digital media platforms and considers how human efforts to create and curate messages directly may impact these stereotypes .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While gender stereotyping in social media and algorithms has received some examination in the recent literature , its prevalence in different types of platforms ( for example , wiki vs. news vs. social network ) and under differing conditions ( for example , degrees of human- and machine-led content creation and curation ) has yet to be studied ."
Research questions	"This research explores the extent to which stereotypes of certain strongly gendered professions ( librarian , nurse , computer programmer , civil engineer ) persist and may vary across digital platforms ( Twitter , the New York Times online , Wikipedia , and Shutterstock ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that gender stereotypes are most likely to be challenged when human beings act directly to create and curate content in digital platforms , and that highly algorithmic approaches for curation showed little inclination towards breaking stereotypes ."
Research questions	"Implications for the more inclusive design and use of digital media platforms , particularly with regard to mediated occupational messaging , are discussed ."
Research questions	The research sought to determine the differences in the perceived usefulness of CBIR technologies among image user groups from several domains and explicate the reasons given regarding the utility of CBIR systems for their professional tasks .
Research method	"Twenty participants ( archaeologists , architects , art historians , and artists ) , individuals who rely on images of cultural materials in the performance of their work , took part in the study ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of the study reveal that interest in CBIR methods varied among the different professional user communities .
Research findings/conclusions	"Individuals who showed an interest in these systems were primarily those concerned with the formal characteristics ( i.e. , color , shape , composition , and texture ) of the images being sought ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , those participants who expressed a strong interest in images of known items , images illustrating themes , and/or items from specific locations believe concept-based searches to be the most direct route ."
Research findings/conclusions	These image users did not see a practical application for CBIR systems in their current work routines .
Research questions	The objective of this study is to characterize the citation patterns in bioinformatics journals and their correspondent knowledge subfields .
Research method	"Our study analyzed bibliometric data ( impact factor , cited-half-life , and references-per-article ) of bioinformatics journals and their related subfields collected from the Journal Citation Reports ( JCR ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions showed that bioinformatics journals ' citations are field-dependent , with scattered patterns in article life span and citing propensity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Bioinformatics journals originally derived from biology-related subfields have shorter article life spans , more citing on average , and higher impact factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Those journals , derived from mathematics and statistics , demonstrate converse citation patterns ."
Research method	"Journal impact factors were normalized , taking into account the impacts of article life spans and citing propensity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A comparison of these normalized factors to JCR journal impact factors showed rearrangements in the ranking orders of a number of individual journals , but a high overall correlation with JCR impact factors ."
Research questions	"Given the increasing popularity of social tagging and the limitations of controlled indexing ( primarily cost and scalability ) , it is reasonable to investigate to what degree social tagging could substitute for controlled indexing ."
Research method	"In this study , we compared CiteULike tags to Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) terms for 231,388 citations indexed in MEDLINE ."
Research method	"In addition to descriptive analyses of the data sets , we present a paper-by-paper analysis of tags and MeSH terms : the number of common annotations , Jaccard similarity , and coverage ratio ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the analysis , we apply three increasingly progressive levels of text processing , ranging from normalization to stemming , to reduce the impact of lexical differences ."
Research method	"Annotations of our corpus consisted of over 76,968 distinct tags and 21,129 distinct MeSH terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	The top 20 tags/MeSH terms showed little direct overlap .
Research findings/conclusions	"On a paper-by-paper basis , the number of common annotations ranged from 0.29 to 0.5 and the Jaccard similarity from 2.12 % to 3.3 % using increased levels of text processing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At most , 77,834 citations ( 33.6 % ) shared at least one annotation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that CiteULike tags and MeSH terms are quite distinct lexically , reflecting different viewpoints/processes between social tagging and controlled indexing ."
Research method	"Our methodological approach supports focused thinking about how online groups differ from each other , and diverge from their face-to-face counterparts ."
Research method	"Group Informatics is grounded in 5 years of empirical studies of technologically mediated groups in online learning , software engineering , online political discourse , crisis informatics , and other domains ."
Research method	"We describe the Group Informatics model and the related , 2-phase methodological approach in detail ."
Research method	Phase one of the methodological approach centers on a set of guiding research questions aimed at directing the application of Group Informatics to new corpora of integrated electronic trace data and qualitative research data .
Research method	Phase 2 of the methodological approach is a systematic set of steps for transforming electronic trace data into weighted social networks .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although these models have already shown good performance , the word independency assumption seems to be unrealistic from a natural language point of view , which considers that terms are related to each other ."
Research questions	"Therefore , such an assumption leads to two well-known problems in information retrieval ( IR ) , namely , polysemy , or term mismatch , and synonymy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In language models , these issues have been addressed by considering dependencies such as bigrams , phrasal-concepts , or word relationships , but such models are estimated using simple n-grams or concept counting ."
Research method	"In this paper , we address polysemy and synonymy mismatch with a concept-based language modeling approach that combines ontological concepts from external resources with frequently found collocations from the document collection ."
Research method	"In addition , the concept-based model is enriched with subconcepts and semantic relationships through a semantic smoothing technique so as to perform semantic matching ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments carried out on TREC collections show that our model achieves significant improvements over a single word-based model and the Markov Random Field model ( using a Markov classifier ) .
Research questions	"Science is increasingly becoming data-intensive , where large volumes of data are collected and analyzed to discover complex patterns through simulations and experiments , and most scientific reference works have been replaced by online curated data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , given a data set , there is no quantitative , consistent , and established way of knowing how it has been used over time , who contributed to its curation , what results have been yielded , or what value it has ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and centrality of traditional scientific products .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Many works in recent years have discussed data citation from different viewpoints : illustrating why data citation is needed , defining the principles and outlining recommendations for data citation systems , and providing computational methods for addressing specific issues of data citation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together diverse aspects of this topic is still missing .
Research questions	"Therefore , this paper aims to describe the lay of the land for data citation , both from the theoretical ( the why and what ) and the practical ( the how ) angle ."
Research questions	"Governments and decision makers at all levels are faced with the huge opportunities generated by the availability of new knowledge and information and , simultaneously , are pressed by tight budget constraints ."
Research questions	"University rankings , in particular , are attracting policy and media attention , but at the same time receive harsh methodological criticism ."
Research findings/conclusions	"After summarizing the main criticisms of rankings , we describe 2 trends in the user requirements for indicators ; namely , granularity and cross-referencing ."
Research findings/conclusions	We then suggest that a change in the paradigm of the design and production of indicators is needed .
Research findings/conclusions	The traditional approach is one that not only leverages on the existing data but also suggests heavy investment to integrate existing databases and to build up tailored indicators .
Research method	"We show , based on the European universities case , how the intelligent integration of existing data may lead to an open-linked data platform which permits the construction of new indicators ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The power of the approach derives from the ability to combine heterogeneous sources of data to generate indicators that address a variety of user requirements without the need to design indicators on a custom basis .
Research method	The paper updates the 1983 analysis of Shaw and Davis .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The difference in the interpretations of information given respectively by Shannon and by Wiener , significant for the information sciences , receives particular consideration ."
Research method	"Analysis of a range of material , from literary theory to thermodynamics , is used to draw out the issues ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Emphasis is placed on recourse to the original sources , and on direct quotation , to attempt to overcome some of the misunderstandings and oversimplifications that have occurred with these topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although it is strongly related to entropy , information is neither identical with it , nor its opposite ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Information is related to order and pattern , but also to disorder and randomness ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The relations between information and the interesting complexity , which embodies both patterns and randomness , are worthy of attention ."
Research questions	"This model is challenged by modern search engines and information retrieval ( IR ) researchers , who often consider Boolean retrieval a less efficient approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The paper examines this claim and argues for the continued value of Boolean systems , and suggests two further considerations : ( a ) the important role of human expertise in searching ( expert searchers and information literate users ) and ( b ) the role of library and information science and knowledge organization ( KO ) in the design and use of classical databases ."
Research questions	An underlying issue is the kind of retrieval system for which one should aim .
Research findings/conclusions	"Warner 's ( 2010 ) differentiation between the computer science traditions and an older library-oriented tradition seems important ; the former aim to transform queries automatically into ( ranked ) sets of relevant documents , whereas the latter aims to increase the selection power of users ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Boolean retrieval model is valuable in providing users with the power to make informed searches and have full control over what is found and what is not .
Research findings/conclusions	These issues may have significant implications for the maintenance of information science and KO as research fields as well as for the information profession as a profession in its own right .
Research questions	"Like other developing and transition countries , it is subject to a growing pressure to internationalize its scientific activities , which primarily means a shift to English as a language of scientific communication ."
Research questions	But to what extent does the transition to English improve the impact of research ?
Research questions	"The case of Russia is of interest in this respect as the existence of many combinations of national journals and languages of publications ( namely , Russian and English , including translated journals ) provide a kind of natural I experiment to test the effects of language and publisher 's country on the international visibility of research through citations as well as on the referencing practices of authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis points to the conclusion that the production of original English-language papers in foreign journals is a more efficient strategy of internationalization than the mere translation of domestic journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"If the objective of a country is to maximize the international visibility of its scientific work , then the efforts should go into the promotion of publication in reputed English-language journals to profit from the added effect provided by the Matthew effect of these venues ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The article highlights the importance of such investments in the development of technology-based companies and their positive impacts on the economic development of regions and countries .
Research questions	It also notes that the managers of venture capital funds struggle to objectify the evaluation of investment proposals .
Research method	"This paper analyzes the selection process of 10 companies , five of which received investments by the largest venture capital fund in Brazil and the other five of which were rejected by this same fund ."
Research method	"We formulated scientometric and patentometric indicators related to each company and conducted a comparative analysis of each by considering the indicators grouped by the nonfinancial criteria ( technology , market , and divestiture team ) from analysis of the investment proposals ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The proposed approach clarifies aspects of the criteria evaluated and contributes to the construction of a method for prioritizing venture capital investments .
Research questions	The distinctiveness of prior art patent citations compared to bibliographic references in the nonpatent literature is discussed .
Research method	"Starting from these observations and using the patent classification scheme as a framework of reference , we have identified a data structure , the technology footprint , derived from the patents cited as prior art for a selected set of patents ."
Research method	"This data structure will provide us with dynamic information about the technological components of the selected set of patents , which represents a technology , company , or inventor ."
Research method	"Two case studies are presented in order to illustrate the visualization of the technology footprint : one concerning an inventor-Mr.Engelbart , the inventor of the computer mouse-and another concerning the early years of a technology-computerized tomography ."
Research findings/conclusions	Comments on these videos might be researched to give insights into audience reactions to important issues or particular videos .
Research questions	"Yet , little is known about YouTube discussions in general : how frequent they are , who typically participates , and the role of sentiment ."
Research method	This article fills this gap through an analysis of large samples of text comments on YouTube videos .
Research findings/conclusions	The results identify patterns and give some benchmarks against which future YouTube research into individual videos can be compared .
Research findings/conclusions	"For instance , the typical YouTube comment was mildly positive , was posted by a 29-year-old male , and contained 58 characters ."
Research findings/conclusions	About 23 % of comments in the complete comment sets were replies to previous comments .
Research findings/conclusions	There was no typical density of discussion on YouTube videos in the sense of the proportion of replies to other comments : videos with both few and many replies were common .
Research findings/conclusions	"The YouTube audience engaged with each other disproportionately when making negative comments , however ; positive comments elicited few replies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The biggest trigger of discussion seemed to be religion , whereas the videos attracting the least discussion were predominantly from the Music , Comedy , and How to & Style categories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This suggests different audience uses for YouTube , from passive entertainment to active debating ."
Research questions	"In a previous article , we reported the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users when performing complex search tasks on the web , and we examined the difficulties encountered when interacting with search interfaces via speech-based screen readers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we use our previous Research findings/conclusions to inform the design of a search interface to support visually impaired users for complex information seeking ."
Research questions	"We particularly focus on implementing TrailNote , a tool to support visually impaired searchers in managing the search process , and we also redesign the spelling-support mechanism using nonspeech sounds to address previously observed difficulties in interacting with this feature ."
Research method	"To enhance the user experience , we have designed interface features to be technically accessible as well as usable with speech-based screen readers ."
Research method	We have evaluated the proposed interface with 12 visually impaired users and studied how they interacted with the interface components .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions show that the search interface was effective in supporting participants for complex information seeking and that the proposed interface features were accessible and usable with speech-based screen readers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study investigates why individuals contribute information to DKRs by applying and extending transactive memory theory .
Research findings/conclusions	"Data from knowledge workers ( N=208 ) nested in work groups ( J=17 ) located in Europe and the United States revealed , consistent with transactive memory theory , that perceptions of experts ' retrieval of information were positively related to the likelihood of information provision to DKRs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The relationship between experts ' perceptions of retrieval and information provision varied from group to group , and cross-level interactions indicated that trust in how the information would be used and the interdependence of tasks within groups could explain that variation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , information provision to DKRs was related to communication networks in ways consistent with theorizing regarding the formation of transactive memory systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Implications for theory and practice are discussed , emphasizing the utility of multilevel approaches for conceptualizing and modeling why individuals provide information to DKRs ."
Research method	This research employed an integrated theoretical framework combining institutional theory and the theory of planned behavior .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The combined theoretical framework can apply the institutional theory at the individual level and extend the theory of planned behavior by including relevant contexts .
Research method	This study utilized a survey method to test the proposed research model and hypotheses .
Research method	"Study participants were recruited from the Community of Science 's ( CoS ) Scholar Database , and a total of 1,528 scientists responded to the survey ."
Research method	"A multilevel analysis method was used to analyze the 1,237 qualified responses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This research showed that scientists ' data reuse intentions are influenced by both disciplinary level factors ( availability of data repositories ) and individual level factors ( perceived usefulness , perceived concern , and the availability of internal resources ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This study has practical implications for promoting data reuse practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three main areas that need to be improved are identified : Educating scientists , providing internal supports , and providing external resources and supports such as data repositories ."
Research findings/conclusions	Structural metadata capture the structural vocabulary in research publications ; referential metadata include not only citations but also data about other types of scholarly output that is based on or related to the same publication .
Research method	"The article describes the structural , descriptive , and referential ( SDR ) elements of the metadata model and explains the underlying assumptions and justifications for each major component in the model ."
Research method	"ScholarWiki , an experimental system developed as a proof of concept , was built over the wiki platform to allow user interaction with the metadata and the editing , deleting , and adding of metadata ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By allowing and encouraging scholars ( both as authors and as users ) to participate in the knowledge and metadata editing and enhancing process , the larger community will benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval ."
Research method	"The ScholarWiki system utilizes machine-learning techniques that can automatically produce self-enhanced metadata by learning from the structural metadata that scholars contribute , which will add intelligence to enhance and update automatically the publication of metadata Wiki pages ."
Research method	"From a comparative analysis of documents from 39 graduate-level introductory courses in archives , reference , and strategic/competitive intelligence taught in 13 American Library Association-accredited library and information science ( LIS ) programs , we identify four defining sociocognitive dimensions of relevance work in information agencies within Hj circle divide rland 's proposed framework for relevance : tasks , time , systems , and assessors ."
Research questions	"This study is intended to supply sociocognitive content from within the relevance work domain to support further domain analytic research , and to emphasize the importance of intermediary relevance work for all subject knowledge domains ."
Research questions	This study aims to investigate the process of communities & apos ; data use for community development and decision-making-focusing on the opportunities and challenges of data for communities .
Research findings/conclusions	"From the interviews with 25 staff from community-based organizations ( CBOs ) in nine small , medium , and large cities in the United States , the Research findings/conclusions of this study describe data & apos ; s role in supporting communities & apos ; development while reporting several major challenges that hinder CBOs data use : difficulty accessing data , limitations of open data ( un-local nature , excluding essential data from being open ) , limited data capacity ( especially in data literacy skills ) , and difficulties using and accessing existing data infrastructures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest opportunities for addressing these challenges , particularly by creating educational programming , building partnerships within data ecosystems , and bringing community voices forward in current data ecosystems , which are critical to realizing data & apos ; s potential for all citizens ."
Research questions	The research reported in this article aims to find the core topics and subtopics of DL research in order to build a knowledge map of the DL domain .
Research method	"The methodology is comprised of a four-step research process , and two knowledge organization methods ( classification and thesaurus building ) were used ."
Research method	"A knowledge map covering 21 core topics and 1,015 subtopics of DL research was created and provides a systematic overview of DL research during the last two decades ( 1990-2010 ) ."
Research questions	"We argue that the map can work as a knowledge platform to guide , evaluate , and improve the activities of DL research , education , and practices ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it can be transformed into a DL ontology for various applications ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The research methodology can be used to map any human knowledge domain ; it is a novel and scientific method for producing comprehensive and systematic knowledge maps based on literary warrant .
Research questions	These terms are deliberately chosen to make strange and help unpack the constitutive capacity of information systems and information technology within and between contemporary organizations .
Research questions	We draw upon the substantial body of work by John Searle to help understand the place of lists and identifiers in the constitution of institutional order .
Research questions	"To enable us to ground our discussion of the potentiality and problematic associated with lists we describe a number of significant instances of list-making , situated particularly around the use of identifiers to refer to people , places , and products ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The theorization developed allows us to better explain not only the significance imbued within lists and identifiers but the key part they play in form-ing the institutional order .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We also hint at the role such symbolic artifacts play within breakdowns in institutional order .
Research questions	"Based on the premises of Activity Theory , this study examines how user characteristics , system experiences , and task situations influence an individual 's preferences among different systems in terms of user readiness to interact with each ."
Research questions	"It hypothesizes that system experiences directly shape specific user readiness at the within-subject level , user characteristics and task situations make differences in general user readiness at the between-subject level , and task situations also affect specific user readiness through the mediation of system experiences ."
Research method	"An empirical study was conducted , and the results supported the hypothesized relationships ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions provide insights on how to enhance technology adoption by tailoring system development and management to various task contexts and different user groups .
Research questions	"In this paper we propose a microblogging recommendation algorithm , TSI-MR ( Topic-Level Social Influence-based Microblogging Recommendation ) , which can significantly improve users ' microblogging experiences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The main innovation of this proposed algorithm is that we consider social influences and their indirect structural relationships , which are largely based on social status theory , from the topic level ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The primary advantage of this approach is that it can build an accurate description of latent relationships between two users with weak connections , which can improve the performance of the model ; furthermore , it can solve sparsity problems of training data to a certain extent ."
Research method	The realization of the model is mainly based on Factor Graph .
Research method	We also applied a distributed strategy to further improve the efficiency of the model .
Research method	"Finally , we use data from Tencent Weibo , one of the most popular microblogging services in China , to evaluate our methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that incorporating social influence can improve microblogging performance considerably , and outperform the baseline methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To facilitate personalized recommendations , the quality of item ratings should be guaranteed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , a few ratings might not be accurate enough due to the uncertainty of user behavior and are referred to as natural noise ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we present a novel fuzzy clustering-based method for detecting noisy ratings ."
Research method	"The entropy of a subset of the original ratings dataset is used to indicate the data-driven uncertainty , and evaluation metrics are adopted to represent the prediction-driven uncertainty ."
Research method	"After the repetition of resampling and the execution of a recommendation algorithm , the entropy and evaluation metrics vectors are obtained and are empirically categorized to identify the proportion of the potential noise ."
Research method	"Then , the fuzzy C-means-based denoising ( FCMD ) algorithm is performed to verify the natural noise under the assumption that natural noise is primarily the result of the exceptional behavior of users ."
Research method	"Finally , a case study is performed using two real-world datasets ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that our proposal outperforms previous proposals and has an advantage in dealing with natural noise .
Research method	We aimed to integrate minimum span clustering ( MSC ) and minimum spanning tree methods to cluster and visualize the global pattern of scientific publications ( PSP ) by analyzing aggregated Science Citation Index ( SCI ) data from 1994 to 2011 .
Research method	"We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries ' geographic location , ethnicity , and level of economic development , as indicated in previous studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal , ethnically similar , or comparable in terms of economic status ."
Research method	Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified .
Research method	"The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization , volume of publications , and relative impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies , adjusting the allocation of resources , and promoting international collaboration for future developments ."
Research questions	"Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment , the research dimension to be assessed , and the Research questionss and policy context of the assessment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process , but less so in another ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For instance , publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active , and those who are not , but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics , including altmetrics , applied at the level of individual articles , individual researchers , research groups , and institutions ."
Research method	It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It introduces the concept of a meta-analysis of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units , but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to different biblical scholars , the number of letters really attributed to Paul varies from 4 to 13 , with a majority agreeing on seven ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This article proposes to revisit this authorship attribution problem by considering two effective methods ( Burrows ' Delta , Labbe 's intertextual distance ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these results , a hierarchical clustering is then applied showing that four clusters can be derived , namely : { Colossians-Ephesians } , { 1 and 2 Thessalonians } , { Titus , 1 and 2 Timothy } , and { Romans , Galatians , 1 and 2 Corinthians } ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , a verification method based on the impostors ' strategy indicates clearly that the group { Colossians-Ephesians } is written by the same author who seems not to be Paul ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The same conclusion can be found for the cluster { Titus , 1 and 2 Timothy } ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Letter to Philemon stays as a singleton , without any close stylistic relationship with the other epistles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , a group of four letters { Romans , Galatians , 1 and 2 Corinthians } is certainly written by the same author ( Paul ) , but the verification protocol also indicates that 2 Corinthians is related to 1 Thessalonians , rendering a clear and simple interpretation difficult ."
Research questions	"While the power-law distribution of node degrees is verified as a basic feature of numerous real networks , we investigate whether the link strengths follow the power-law distribution in weighted networks ."
Research method	"After testing 12 different paper cocitation networks with 2 methods , fitting in double-log scales and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( K-S test ) , we observe that , in most cases , the link strengths also follow the approximate power-law distribution ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that the power-law type distribution could emerge not only in nodes and informational entities , but also in links and informational connections ."
Research method	The framework is related to examples from a study of two Swedish public libraries .
Research questions	"Antagonism is viewed as foundational , and democracy as an ongoing process , the task being to transform antagonism to agonism , with institutions like libraries postulated as important spaces for adversaries to meet in dialogue ."
Research questions	"Libraries are viewed here as constantly becoming institutions , and the librarian 's identity as an ongoing enactment of the library ."
Research method	"To underscore the crucial role the library fills in society , it is conceptualized as a verb and a new word is proposed : to librarize ."
Research questions	Discussions about the content of libraries are critical for librarians to find ways to perform the library .
Research findings/conclusions	The ongoing debate is part of the professional performance of librarians .
Research findings/conclusions	"Librarians should , while acknowledging that there may be no single right way , debate over what is the most beneficial way to facilitate libraries ' vital role in democracy ."
Research findings/conclusions	Conceptualizing of the library as a verb and its implications for librarianship as a possible active agent for radical change within society are offered as articulations of resistance .
Research method	It focuses on information practices in everyday patient care by a team of senior and junior physicians in a university teaching hospital .
Research method	"A practice-oriented , interpretative case study approach , in which elements from activity theory , situated learning theory , and communities of practice framework , was developed to form the theoretical basis for the study ."
Research method	The qualitative data from observations and interviews were analyzed with iterative coding techniques .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions reveal that physicians ' learning through everyday access to medical information is enacted by , embedded in , and sustained as a part of the work activity itself ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate a stable community of practice with traits of both local and general medical conventions , in which the value of used sources and strategies remains relatively uncontested , strongly based on formally and informally sanctioned and legitimized practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the present study is particular and context specific , the results indicate a more generally plausible conclusion ; the complementary nature of different information sources and strategies underscores that access to information happens in a context in which solitary sources alone make little difference ."
Research method	"We studied 22 , four-person teams performing 2 hidden profile taskssimple and complexin a controlled setting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Transparency of the interactions , achieved through the visibility of ratings , influenced changes in participants ' preferences as measured before , during and after the team discussion ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Visibility of team scores could then offer an effective way to reach consensus , despite individual incumbent preferences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Changes between individuals ' initial preferences and team preferences were found to be larger for members working on a complex task compared to a simple task , as were changes between individuals ' prediscussion and postdiscussion preferences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although prior studies established that the initial preferences of individual team members are rather sticky , this study reveals that individuals adjusted their initial preferences to reach a team consensus , as well as modified their preferences after team discussions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Despite the mixed earlier research results on the impact of GDSS on efficient decision making , Research findings/conclusions from this study suggest that in complex decision-making contexts , GDSS tools can be effective in enabling consensus building in groups ."
Research questions	"This essay argues that underrepresented and otherwise marginalized scholars have already produced significant work within social , cultural , and community-oriented paradigms ; social justice and advocacy ; and , diversity , equity , and inclusion ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work has not been sufficiently valued or promoted .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the surrounding structural conditions have resulted in the dismissal , violently reviewed and rejected , and erased work of underrepresented scholars , and the stigmatization and delegitimization of their work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These scholars are outsiders-within-LIS .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By identifying the outsiders-within-LIS through the frame of standpoint theories , the authors are suggesting that a new paradigm does not need to be created ; rather , an existing paradigm needs to be recognized and reprioritized ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This reprioritized paradigm of critical sociocultural work has and will continue to creatively enrich and expand the field and decolonize LIS curricula .
Research questions	"In the past few years , a research trend has focused on the construction of educational ontologies , that is , ontologies to be used for educational Research questionss ."
Research findings/conclusions	The identification of the terminology is crucial to build ontologies .
Research method	Term extraction techniques allow the identification of the domain-related terms from electronic resources .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper presents LiTeWi , a novel method that combines current unsupervised term extraction approaches for creating educational ontologies for technology supported learning systems from electronic textbooks ."
Research method	LiTeWi uses Wikipedia as an additional information source .
Research findings/conclusions	"Wikipedia contains more than 30 million articles covering the terminology of nearly every domain in 288 languages , which makes it an appropriate generic corpus for term extraction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , given that its content is available in several languages , it promotes both domain and language independence ."
Research questions	"LiTeWi is aimed at being used by teachers , who usually develop their didactic material from textbooks ."
Research method	"To evaluate its performance , LiTeWi was tuned up using a textbook on object oriented programming and then tested with two textbooks of different domainsastronomy and molecular biology ."
Research questions	"However , past studies have shown that the cost of organization can be too high for some users to be worth the effort ."
Research questions	Mixed-initiative approaches attempt to reduce the burden of manual organization by automatically identifying and suggesting organizational units such as folders to users .
Research questions	"However , little is known about how such mixed-initiative approaches influence users ' organizational experiences ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we explore a mixed-initiative approach that suggests high-level organizational units to users to facilitate e-mail organization ."
Research method	"In 2 in-situ experiments with 34 knowledge workers , we study how our mixed-initiative approach influenced users ' experience with organization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that our approach made it easier to create organizational units without negatively affecting recall of those units , and led to the creation of units that otherwise would have not been created ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions suggest ways computers and people can most effectively work together to organize information .
Research findings/conclusions	The procedure requires the availability of both adequate data sets and trusted metrics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Few indicators have been developed to deal specifically with individual assessment .
Research findings/conclusions	"The h-type indices are the most popular category ; however , the dependence of h-type metrics on publication age and field makes their application often unjustified ."
Research questions	This article studies the effects that publication age and field normalization have on h-type citation values of German Leibniz Prize winners .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This data set is exclusive in that it is highly scrutinized for homonyms .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Results are compared with other field-normalized citation rates , contributing to the debate on using demarcation versus average citation approaches to evaluate top researchers ."
Research questions	This article investigates the practices associated with the roles of participants who actively contribute to the coproduction of knowledge in three online communities and how these roles differ in controversial and noncontroversial threads .
Research method	"The Measles , Mumps , and Rubella ( MMR ) vaccine was selected as a contentious scientific topic because of persistent belief about an alleged link between the vaccine and autism ."
Research method	Contributions to three online communities that engage mothers with young children were analyzed to identify participant roles .
Research findings/conclusions	"No consistent roles were evident in noncontroversial threads , but the role of mediator consistently appeared in controversial threads in all three communities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study helps to articulate the roles played in online communities that engage in knowledge collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	The variety of roles in online communities has implications for both the study for practice and the design of information technologies .
Research method	"It presents the general characteristics ( age , type of publisher , and theme ) and analyzes the distribution model by studying the type of format ( print or digital ) , the type of access ( open access or subscription ) , and the technology platform used ."
Research method	The 549 journals analyzed ( 249 in Brazil and 300 in Spain ) are included in the 2011 Web of Science ( WoS ) and Scopus databases .
Research method	Data on each journal were collected directly from their websites between March and October 2012 .
Research findings/conclusions	"Brazil has a fully open access distribution model ( 97 % ) in which few journals require payment by authors thanks to cultural , financial , operational , and technological support provided by public agencies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In Spain , open access journals account for 55 % of the total and have also received support from public agencies , although to a lesser extent ."
Research findings/conclusions	These results show that there are systems support of open access in scientific journals other than the author pays model advocated by the Finch report for the United Kingdom .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on interviews with 28 information seekers and 12 health professionals ( HPs ) , Research findings/conclusions demonstrate that participants accessed and valued a wide range of information sources , moved fluidly between formal and informal sources , and trust was strengthened through interaction and referral between sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants were motivated to seek information to prepare for formal encounters with HPs , evaluate and/or supplement information already gathered , establish that they were normal , understand and address the physical embodiment of their experiences , and prepare for future information needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions revealed four strategies used to construct sense from health information mediated by the many information sources encountered and accessed on an everyday basis : women assumed analytic and experiential postures ; they valued social contexts for learning and knowledge construction ; information consistency was used as a heuristic representing accuracy and credibility ; and an important feature of sense making was source complementarity .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for health information literacy and patient education are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"A combination of design decisions , altered affordances , and political struggles within a state cloud computing implementation reduced levels of service among records management professionals , in spite of their strongly expressed desire to manage records with excellence ."
Research questions	Struggles to maintain ownership and control over organizational processes and resources illustrate the power dynamics that are affected by the design of a new system implementation .
Research findings/conclusions	"By designing the system with a single goal in mind ( centralization to reduce costs ) , strategic management failed to consider otherwise predictable outcomes of reducing the resources controlled by a group with lesser power and increasing the resources controlled by an already dominant power within the institution ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These Research findings/conclusions provide valuable insights into the considerations which cloud computing designs should take into account .
Research value/outlook/limitations	They also offer an understanding of changing educational requirements for records management workers to engage more effectively across occupations in technologically changing environments and the potential risks that cloud computing provide to productivity .
Research method	"The research was comprised of an extensive literature review , a grounded theory methodological approach , and rigorous data collection and synthesis via an empirical case study ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this study , the determinants of inpatient physicians ' continuous use of EMR were studied ."
Research method	"Four dimensions of EMR use were analyzed : use intensity , use extent , use frequency , and use scope ."
Research method	"A web-based survey was administered to physicians at a large university hospital ; respondents filled out a survey with questions relating to their EMR use , attitude , beliefs , work style , and dispositional resistance to change ."
Research method	Structural equation modeling was carried out to analyze the relationship between these factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"Physicians were found to differ substantially in the scope , extent , and intensity of their EMR use ."
Research findings/conclusions	Their attitude toward EMR use was associated with all use dimensions .
Research findings/conclusions	Dispositional resistance to change was negatively related to perceived ease of use and with perceived usefulness both directly and through the mediation of compatibility with preferred work style .
Research findings/conclusions	Time loss was negatively related to both perceived usefulness and attitude toward EMR use .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for research and practice are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed theoretical model predicts a monotonically decreasing function of the impact factor as a function of publication delay , on condition that the citation curve of the journal is monotone increasing during the publication window used in the calculation of the journal impact factor ; otherwise , this function has a reversed U shape ."
Research method	"Our Research findings/conclusions based on simulations are verified by examining three journals in the information sciences : the Journal of Informetrics , Scientometrics , and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology ."

Research method	Percentiles normalize the impact of papers with respect to their publication year and field without using the arithmetic average .
Research value/outlook/limitations	They are suitable for visualizing the performance of a single scientist .
Research findings/conclusions	Beam plots make it possible to present the distributions of percentiles in the different publication years combined with the medians from these percentiles within each year and across all years .
Research method	"We analyzed 829,924 articles that received 16,490,346 citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The number of articles published through coauthorship accounts for 89 % .
Research findings/conclusions	The citation-based performance and coauthorship patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.20 +/- 0.07 .
Research findings/conclusions	Citations to a subfield 's research articles tended to increase 2 .
Research findings/conclusions	( 1.20 ) or 2.30 times each time it doubled the number of coauthored papers .
Research findings/conclusions	The scaling exponent for the power-law relationship for single-authored papers was 0.85 +/- 0.11 .
Research findings/conclusions	The citations to a subfield 's single-authored research articles increased 2 .
Research findings/conclusions	( 0.85 ) or 1.89 times each time the research area doubled the number of single-authored papers .
Research findings/conclusions	The Matthew Effect is stronger for coauthored papers than for single-authored .
Research findings/conclusions	"In fact , with a scaling exponent < 1.0 the impact of single-authored papers exhibits a cumulative disadvantage or inverse Matthew Effect ."
Research method	A theoretical model was developed that integrates research on ILI outcomes and technology adoption .
Research method	"To test this model , a web-based survey , which included both closed and open-ended questions , was administered to 337 business students ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions indicate that the ILI received by students is beneficial in the initial or early stages of OLR use ; however , students quickly reach a saturation point where more instruction contributes little , if anything , to the final outcome , such as reduced OLR anxiety and increased OLR self-efficacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Rather , it is the independent , continuous use of OLR after receiving initial , formal ILI that creates continued positive effects ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Importantly , OLR self-efficacy and anxiety were found to be important antecedents to OLR adoption ."
Research findings/conclusions	OLR anxiety also partially mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and perceived ease of use .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for theory and practice are discussed .
Research questions	"Automatically annotating images is becoming indispensable for effective information retrieval , since the number of geo-referenced images available online is growing , yet many images are insufficiently tagged or captioned to be efficiently searchable by standard information retrieval procedures ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The Tripod project developed original methods for automatically annotating geo-referenced images by generating representations of the likely visible footprint of a geo-referenced image , and using this footprint to query spatial databases and web resources ."
Research method	"These queries return raw lists of potential keywords and toponyms , which are subsequently filtered and ranked ."
Research method	This article reports on user experiments designed to evaluate the quality of the generated annotations .
Research method	"The experiments combined quantitative and qualitative approaches : To retrieve a large number of responses , participants rated the annotations in standardized online questionnaires that showed an image and its corresponding keywords ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , several focus groups provided rich qualitative information in open discussions ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the evaluation show that currently the annotation method performs better on rural images than on urban ones .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , for each image at least one suitable keyword could be generated ."
Research findings/conclusions	The integration of heterogeneous data sources resulted in some images having a high level of noise in the form of obviously wrong or spurious keywords .
Research findings/conclusions	The article discusses the evaluation itself and methods to improve the automatic generation of annotations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study describes and explains the variety of approaches to health information interactions made by patients on hemodialysis .
Research method	"Ethnographic observations ( 156 hours ) were conducted in three hemodialysis clinics , and semistructured interviews about health information were held with 28 patients ."
Research method	Demographic data were collected .
Research method	Data were analyzed qualitatively .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found a spectrum of five approaches to health information : avoiders , who close themselves off from health information ; receivers , who encounter information in the dialysis clinic but do not seek it out ; askers , who only pose questions about health to their healthcare providers but otherwise do not seek ; seekers , who actively look for health information both in and out of the clinic ; and verifiers , who seek information and triangulate it among multiple sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	Trust in healthcare providers and coping sociality differed across approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions indicate that health information should be provided to patients using strategies tailored to their preferences and existing approaches to information interaction .
Research findings/conclusions	"The consequent uncertainty causes vagueness , threatening patient safety and the quality of care ."
Research method	"This article is motivated by the design science paradigm and describes the interprofessional decision-making model for the complex patient , namely , INDECO along with an example instantiation ."
Research method	"Drawing on our experience in an intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in Israel , the bi-dimensional view of this model includes the medical- and the interprofessional perspective ."
Research method	Retrospective assessment of 3 case studies of complex patients is used for assessing the usefulness of INDECO in decision making .
Research method	"The study reported here draws support from relevant literature , including the information science , information systems , and the medical domains ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions resonate with emerging research developments focusing on healthcare decision making .
Research findings/conclusions	"We proposed four levels of outcomes of informationseeking : situational relevance , cognitive impact , information use , and patient health outcomes ."
Research method	Our objective was to produce clinical vignettes for describing and testing these levels .
Research method	We conducted a mixed methods study combining a quantitative longitudinal study and a qualitative multiple case study .
Research method	"Participants were 10 nurses , 10 medical residents , and 10 pharmacists ."
Research method	"They had access to an online resource , and did 793 searches for treatment recommendations ."
Research method	"Using the Information Assessment Method ( IAM ) , participants rated their searches for each of the four levels ."
Research method	Rated searches were examined in interviews guided by log reports and a think-aloud protocol .
Research method	Cases were defined as clearly described searches where clinical information was used for a specific patient .
Research findings/conclusions	"For each case , interviewees described the four levels of outcomes ."
Research method	Quantitative and qualitative data were merged into clinical vignettes .
Research method	We produced 130 clinical vignettes .
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , 46 vignettes ( 35.4 % ) corresponded to clinical situations where information use was associated with one or more than one type of positive patient health outcome : increased patient knowledge ( n = 28 ) , avoidance of unnecessary or inappropriate intervention ( n = 25 ) , prevention of disease or health deterioration ( n = 9 ) , health improvement ( n = 6 ) , and increased patient satisfaction ( n = 3 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results suggested information use was associated with perceived benefits for patients .
Research findings/conclusions	This may encourage clinicians to search for information more often when they feel the need .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results supported the four proposed levels of outcomes , which can be transferable to other information-seeking contexts ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article argues for adding a non-individualistic lens for understanding information .
Research findings/conclusions	"The necessity for adding a non-individualistic lens grows from that the existing individualistic lens appears inadequate to make sense of information phenomenon , in particular when it comes to understanding problematic information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Non-individualistic is proposed as a complementary perspective , which needs to be further developed conceptually ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To begin such development , this article directs information professionals ' attention to the promising concept of information ecology ."
Research questions	"More specifically , this article pulls resources from philosophy of information ( Floridi 's infosphere ) and information ethics ( Capurro 's Angeletics ) to illustrate existing conceptualizations of information ecology ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Information ecology appears to align with this sociotechnical view that information researchers have started to develop in the most recent years , though arguably information ecology may have an even broader scope ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Lastly , this article also points out that the conceptualization of information ecology needs to be aware of , and cautious of the philosophical assumption that is relied on for understanding information ."
Research method	"The proposed companion metric reflects the impact of the journal in which an article appears ; the rationale for incorporating this information is to reflect higher costs of production and higher review standards , and to mitigate the heavily truncated citation counts that often arise in promotion , renewal , and tenure deliberations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Additionally , focusing jointly on citations and journal impact diversifies the assessment process , and can thereby help avoid misjudging scholars with modest citation counts in high-level journals ."
Research method	"A combination of both metrics is also proposed , which nests each as a special case ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The approach is demonstrated using a generic journal ranking metric , but can be adapted to most any stated or revealed preference measure of journal impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is shown that their contribution is growing exponentially .
Research findings/conclusions	In 2013 almost one fifth of all publications in this journal had at least one Chinese author .
Research findings/conclusions	The average number of citations per publication is approximately the same for articles with a Chinese author and for articles without any Chinese coauthor .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using the odds-ratio , we could not find arguments that Chinese authors in PLOS ONE excessively cite other Chinese contributions ."
Research method	This database launched in 2012 links data sets and data studies with citations received from the other citation indexes .
Research method	The DCI harvests citations to research data from papers indexed in the Web of Science .
Research method	It relies on the information provided by the data repository .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of this study show that data citation practices are far from common in most research fields .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some differences have been reported on the way researchers cite data : Although in the areas of science and engineering & technology data sets were the most cited , in the social sciences and arts & humanities data studies play a greater role ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A total of 88.1 % of the records have received no citation , but some repositories show very low uncitedness rates ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although data citation practices are rare in most fields , they have expanded in disciplines such as crystallography and genomics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude by emphasizing the role that the DCI could play in encouraging the consistent , standardized citation of research dataa role that would enhance their value as a means of following the research process from data collection to publication ."
Research questions	"Mental health forums are online communities where people express their issues , and seek help from moderators and other users ."
Research questions	"In such forums , there are often posts with severe content indicating that the user is in acute distress and there is a risk of attempted self-harm ."
Research findings/conclusions	Moderators need to respond to these severe posts in a timely manner to prevent potential self-harm .
Research questions	"However , the large volume of daily posted content makes it difficult for the moderators to locate and respond to these critical posts ."
Research method	We propose an approach for triaging user content into four severity categories that are defined based on an indication of self-harm ideation .
Research method	"Our models are based on a feature-rich classification framework , which includes lexical , psycholinguistic , contextual , and topic modeling features ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our approaches improve over the state of the art in triaging the content severity in mental health forums by large margins ( up to 17 % improvement over the F-1 scores ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , using our proposed model , we analyze the mental state of users and we show that overall , long-term users of the forum demonstrate decreased severity of risk over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis on the interaction of the moderators with the users further indicates that without an automatic way to identify critical content , it is indeed challenging for the moderators to provide timely response to the users in need ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous work has stressed that data-sharing projects need to be sustainable in the long term , and highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the operation model of existing data-sharing initiatives ."
Research method	"To investigate this important issue , we took a qualitative approach to uncover the dynamics of value creation in data sharing ."
Research method	"Using a case study method , we examined two data-sharing sites across different areas ."
Research method	"We conducted semistructured interviews with managers from data centers and other stakeholders , and reviewed documents about the technical and managerial practices to determine the main characteristics of their business models ."
Research method	"In addition , we applied the e3-value modeling methodology to tease out the value flows within each site ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions demonstrated the importance of the value network dimension of a business model , as data sharing relies on a set of actors creating and getting value in the process , and the significance of intangible assets ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The main contributions of this study include extending current understanding on data-sharing business models by analyzing key dimensions , and uncovering how value is created and transferred in data sharing ."
Research questions	How do users judge the relevance of such information ?
Research questions	"Is their relevance judgment affected by contextual factors , such as location and time ?"
Research questions	How do message content and contextual factors affect users ' privacy concerns ?
Research method	"With a focus on mobile ads , we propose a research model based on theories of relevance judgment and mobile marketing research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We suggest topicality , reliability , and economic value as key content factors and location and time as key contextual factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found mobile relevance judgment is affected mainly by content factors , whereas privacy concerns are affected by both content and contextual factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , topicality and economic value have a synergetic effect that makes a message more relevant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Higher topicality and location precision exacerbate privacy concerns , whereas message reliability alleviates privacy concerns caused by location precision ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions reveal an interesting intricacy in user relevance judgment and privacy concerns and provide nuanced guidance for the design and delivery of mobile commercial information .
Research method	The categorization makes use of a variable percentile approach based on recently developed h-related indices .
Research findings/conclusions	"Building on this categorization , a new index is proposed for researchers , the fame-index or f ( 2 ) -index ."
Research findings/conclusions	This new index integrates some qualitative elements related to the influence of a researcher 's articles .
Research findings/conclusions	It better mitigates than the classic h-index .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , little has been done on connecting the 2 most adopted music mood representation models : categorical and dimensional ."
Research method	"To bridge these gaps , we constructed a new data set consisting of 818 Chinese Pop ( C-Pop ) songs , 3 complete sets of mood annotations in both representations , as well as audio features corresponding to 5 distinct categories of musical characteristics ."
Research method	The mood space of C-Pop songs was analyzed and compared to that of Western Pop songs .
Research findings/conclusions	We also explored the relationship between categorical and dimensional annotations and the results revealed that one set of annotations could be reliably predicted by the other .
Research method	"Classification and regression experiments were conducted on the data set , providing benchmarks for future research on MMR of non-Western music ."
Research method	"Based on these analyses , we reflect and discuss the implications of the Research findings/conclusions to MMR research ."
Research questions	We use the technology-organization-environment ( TOE ) framework to investigate factors influencing social network adoption .
Research method	The authors use cross-sectional data from 130 countries .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that social network adoption , at the country level , is positively influenced by the technological maturity , public readiness , and information and communication technology law sophistication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Technological , organizational , and environmental factors altogether accounted for 67 % of variance in social network adoption ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These Research findings/conclusions provide a first insight into the usage of social network sites at the country level , as well as the main factors that influence public adoption ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for research and practice are discussed .
Research questions	The theory of BOs was originally introduced by Star and Griesemer in a study on information practices at the Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology but has since been adapted in a broad range of research contexts in a large number of disciplines including the various branches of information science .
Research questions	"The aim of this review article is to present an overview of the state-of-the-art of information science research informed by the theory of BOs , critically discuss the notion , and propose a structured overview of how the notion has been applied in the study of information ."
Research questions	"To this end , many graph-based ranking algorithms have been proposed ."
Research questions	"However , most of these algorithms suffer from the problem of ranking bias ."
Research findings/conclusions	Ranking bias hurts the usefulness of a ranking algorithm because it returns a ranking list with an undesirable time distribution .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper is a focused study on how to alleviate ranking bias by leveraging the heterogeneous network structure of the literature collection .
Research questions	"We propose a new graph-based ranking algorithm , MutualRank , that integrates mutual reinforcement relationships among networks of papers , researchers , and venues to achieve a more synthetic , accurate , and less-biased ranking than previous methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"MutualRank provides a unified model that involves both intra- and inter-network information for ranking papers , researchers , and venues simultaneously ."
Research method	We use the ACL Anthology Network as the benchmark data set and construct the gold standard from computer linguistics course websites of well-known universities and two well-known textbooks .
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results show that MutualRank greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors , including PageRank , HITS , CoRank , Future Rank , and P-Rank , in ranking papers in both improving ranking effectiveness and alleviating ranking bias ."
Research findings/conclusions	Rankings of researchers and venues by MutualRank are also quite reasonable .
Research method	"Drawing on developmental psychology and Communication Privacy Management ( CPM ) theory , we conduct a qualitative study to examine the challenge between parental concern for adolescent online safety and teens ' desire to independently regulate their own online experiences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Analysis of 12 parent-teen pairs revealed five distinct challenges : ( a ) increased teen autonomy and decreased parental control resulting from teens ' direct and unmediated access to virtual spaces , ( b ) the shift in power to teens who are often more knowledgeable about online spaces and technology , ( c ) the use of physical boundaries by parents as a means to control virtual spaces , ( d ) an increase in indirect boundary control strategies such as covert monitoring , and ( e ) the blurring of lines in virtual spaces between parents ' teens and teens ' friends ."
Research questions	"It is likely that the importance of articulating and sharing rationales will be increasingly acknowledged in online crowdsourcing because in such a context , large-scale participation is expected with participants often not knowing each other and being flexible about their participation status ( e.g. , participants may join after the activity has started and leave before it completes ) , and thus more grounding efforts/support are expected ."
Research method	"To better understand the role of shared rationales in online crowdsourcing , three experiments were conducted investigating whether and how rationale awareness affects the ideation crowdsourcing task and idea-evaluation crowdsourcing task based on the Research findings/conclusions about the rationale awareness effects in small-group idea-generation activities ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that one 's awareness of previous workers ' rationales in the current task can slightly improve the average quality of generated ideas in an iterative approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , one 's evaluation of an idea could be positively or negatively affected by the idea 's rationale depending on the quality of the rationales ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results also suggest that showing previous workers ' rationales in the ideation task may not be an effective approach for improving the best quality of generated ideas .
Research method	"In this paper , we present a detailed analysis of networks of U.S.-based organizations , where edges represent three different kinds of relationships , namely owner-owned ( ownerships ) , donor-donee ( donations ) , and service provider-payee ( transactions ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that in the ownerships network , the financial organizations form the core , and banking organizations hold strategic locations in the network ."
Research method	"In the transactions network , the government organizations and agencies form the core , and defense-related organizations form the backbone ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , with the donations network , no specific domain of organizations forms either the core or the backbone ."
Research questions	It aims to bridge the gap in extant research on this topic .
Research findings/conclusions	This study demonstrates that the patent h-index has a triple threshold effect on the relationship between patent citations and market value .
Research findings/conclusions	"When the patent h-index is less than or equal to the lowest threshold , 4 , there is a positive relationship between patent citations and market value ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study indicates that the first regime ( where the patent h-index is less than or equal to 4 ) is optimal , because this is where the extent of the positive relationship between patent citations and market value is the greatest ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This monetizing process introduces a more complicated cost and benefit tradeoff to users , especially for askers ' concerns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Much of the previous research was conducted in the context of free-based Q & A platform , which hardly explains the triggers that motivate askers ' pay intention ."
Research questions	"Based on the theories of social exchange and social capital , this study aims to identify and examine the antecedents of askers ' pay intention from the perspective of benefit and cost ."
Research method	We empirically test our predictions based on survey data collected from 322 actual askers in a well-known trilateral payment-based social Q & A platform in China .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results by partial least squares ( PLS ) analysis indicate that besides noneconomic benefits including self-enhancement , social support , and entertainment , financial factors such as cost and benefit have significant influences on the perceived value of using trilateral payment-based Q & A platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More important , we further identify that the effect of financial benefit is moderated by perceived reciprocity belief , and the effect of perceived value is moderated by perceived trust in answerers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our Research findings/conclusions contribute to the previous literature by proposing a theoretical model that explains askers ' behavioral intention , and the practical implications for payment-based Q & A service providers and participants ."
Research method	"In this article , we build on research about web tasks and present an in-depth evaluation of the types of tasks people perform on the web over multiple web sessions ."
Research questions	Multisession web tasks are goal-based tasks that often contain subtasks requiring more than one web session to complete .
Research method	We will detail the results of two longitudinal studies that we conducted to explore this topic .
Research method	The first study was a weeklong web-diary study where participants self-reported information on their own multisession tasks .
Research method	"The second study was a monthlong field study where participants used a customized version of Firefox , which logged their interactions for both their own multisession tasks and their other web activity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results from both studies found that people perform eight different types of multisession tasks , that these tasks often consist of several subtasks , that these lasted different lengths of time , and that users have unique strategies to help continue the tasks which involved a variety of web and browser tools such as search engines and bookmarks and external applications such as Notepad or Word ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using the results from these studies , we have suggested three guidelines for developers to consider when designing browser-tool features to help people perform these types of tasks : ( a ) to maintain a list of current multisession tasks , ( b ) to support multitasking , and ( c ) to manage task-related information between sessions ."
Research method	"Bibliographic data were collected for 3,422 articles published in LIS journals in the years 2006 , 2012 , and 2018 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While the classification schemes provided in the Jarvelin studies do not indicate much change , an analysis of subtopics , data sources , and keywords indicates a substantial impact of social media and data science on the discipline , which emerged at some point between the years of 2012 and 2018 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions suggest a type of shift in the focus of LIS research , with social media and data science topics playing a role in well over one-third of articles published in 2018 , compared with approximately 5 % in 2012 and virtually none in 2006 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The shift in LIS research foci based on these two technologies/approaches appears similar in extent to those produced by the introduction of information systems in library science in the 1960s , or the Internet in the 1990s , suggesting that these recent advancements are fundamental to the identity of LIS as a discipline ."
Research questions	"Several new research questions , methodologies , and systems have emerged around these notions that may prove to be useful beyond the field of collaborative information seeking ( CIS ) , with relevance to the broader area of information seeking and behavior ."
Research method	"This article provides an overview of such key research work from a variety of domains , including library and information science , computer-supported cooperative work , human-computer interaction , and information retrieval ."
Research questions	"It starts with explanations of collaboration and how CIS fits in different contexts , emphasizing the interactive , intentional , and mutually beneficial nature of CIS activities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Relations to similar and related fields such as collaborative information retrieval , collaborative information behavior , and collaborative filtering are also clarified ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Next , the article presents a synthesis of various frameworks and models that exist in the field today , along with a new synthesis of 12 different dimensions of group activities ."
Research method	A discussion on issues and approaches relating to evaluating various parameters in CIS follows .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , a list of known issues and challenges is presented to provide an overview of research opportunities in this field ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As a consequence , a great deal of research on the IT outsourcing domain , covering a wide range of issues , has been conducted ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study investigates the IT outsourcing knowledge infrastructure from a network point of view .
Research method	Triple helix indicators and social network analysis techniques are employed on 288 scholarly papers obtained from the Web of Science database using keywords related to IT outsourcing .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results reveal the key players in IT outsourcing research collaborations ; their network characteristics , such as degree centrality ; and the relationship of academia , industry , and government in terms of IT outsourcing knowledge production ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article also provides results-based implications .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Currently , the practice of formal data citation-where data references are included alongside bibliographic references in the reference section of a publication-is uncommon ."
Research method	"We examine the prevalence of data citation , documenting data sharing and reuse , in a sample of full text articles from the biological/biomedical sciences , the fields with the most public data sets available documented by the Data Citation Index ( DCI ) ."
Research method	We develop a method that combines automated text extraction with human assessment for revealing candidate occurrences of data sharing and reuse by using terms that are most likely to indicate their occurrence .
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis reveals that informal data citation in the main text of articles is far more common than formal data citations in the references of articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , data sharers do not receive documented credit for their data contributions in a similar way as authors do for their research articles because informal data citations are not recorded in sources such as the DCI ."
Research findings/conclusions	Ongoing challenges for the study of data citation are also outlined .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study identifies types of social support in the QuitStop forum and brings insights to exchange patterns of social support and user behaviors with content analysis and social network analysis .
Research method	"Motivated by user information behavior , this study defines two patterns to describe social support exchange : initiated support exchange and invited support exchange ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is found that users with a longer quitting time tend to actively give initiated support , and recent quitters with a shorter abstinent time are likely to seek and receive invited support ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study also finds that support givers of informational support quit longer ago than support givers of nurturant support , and support receivers of informational support quit more recently than support receivers of nurturant support ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Usually , informational support is offered by users at late quit stages to users at early quit stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Nurturant support is also exchanged among users within the same quit stage .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions help us understand how health consumers are supporting each other and reveal new capabilities of online intervention programs that can be designed to offer social support in a timely and effective manner .
Research questions	"Cloud storage , personal network-attached storage ( NAS ) , and external hard drives are more affordable than ever before and one would think that backing up personal digital information is a straightforward process nowadays ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite this , small group studies and corporate surveys show the opposite ."
Research method	In this paper we present the results from a quantitative and qualitative survey of 319 participants about how they back up their personal computers and restore personal information in case of computer failures .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the majority of users do manual , selective , and noncontinuous backups , rely on a set of planned and unplanned backups ( as a consequence of other activities ) , have inadequate knowledge about possible solutions and implications of using known solutions , and so on ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study also reveals that around a fifth of all computers are not backed up , and a quarter of most important files and a third of most important folders at the time of the survey could not be ( fully ) restored in the event of computer failure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the results , several implications for practice and research are presented ."
Research questions	"In reality , their world is part-paper/part-digital , in constant transition among successive forms of digital storage and communication devices ."
Research questions	"Studying for a degree is the daily work of these young people , and effective management of paper and digital academic materials and resources contributes crucially to their success in life ."
Research findings/conclusions	Students must also constantly manage their work against deadlines to meet their course and university requirements .
Research questions	"This study , following the Personal Information Management ( PIM ) paradigm , examines student academic information management under these various constraints and pressures ."
Research method	"A total of 41 18- to 22-year-old students were interviewed and observed regarding the content , structure , and uses of their immediate working environment within their dormitory rooms ."
Research findings/conclusions	Students exhibited remarkable creativity and variety in the mixture of automated and manual resources and devices used to support their academic work .
Research findings/conclusions	"The demands of a yearlong procession of assignments , papers , projects , and examinations increase the importance of time management activities and influence much of their behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results provide insights on student use of various kinds of information technology and their overall planning and management of information associated with their studies .
Research findings/conclusions	Access rate falls as an inverse power of time passed since publication .
Research findings/conclusions	"The power law holds for periods of up to 1,000 days ."
Research findings/conclusions	The exponents are different for different blogs and are distributed between 0.6 and 3.2 .
Research questions	We argue that the decay of attention to a web article is caused by the link to it first dropping down the list of links on the website 's front page and then disappearing from the front page and its subsequent movement further into background .
Research findings/conclusions	"The other proposed explanations that use a decaying with time novelty factor , or some intricate theory of human dynamics , can not explain all of the experimental observations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"But a journal has multidimensional prestige only if it is a prestigious journal with respect to a number of dimensionse.g. , Institute for Scientific Information Impact Factor , immediacy index , eigenfactor score , and article influence score ."
Research findings/conclusions	The multidimensional prestige of influential journals takes into account the fact that several prestige indicators should be used for a distinct analysis of the impact of scholarly journals in a subject category .
Research method	"After having identified the multidimensionally influential journals , their prestige scores can be aggregated to produce a summary measure of multidimensional prestige for a subject category , which satisfies numerous properties ."
Research method	"Using this measure of multidimensional prestige to rank subject categories , we have found the top scientific subject categories of Web of Knowledge as of 2010 ."
Research method	"The activities of asking for and providing information in a forum were explored , and a set of messages extracted from a French forum targeting adolescents was analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results show that the messages initiating the threads are often requests for information .
Research findings/conclusions	Teenagers mainly ask for peers ' opinions on personal matters and specific verifiable information .
Research findings/conclusions	"The discussions following these requests take the form of an exchange of advice ( question/answer ) or a coconstruction of the final answer between the participants ( with assessments of participants ' responses , requests for explanations , etc . ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that discussion forums present different advantages for adolescents ' information-seeking activities .
Research findings/conclusions	The first is that this social medium allows finding specialized information on topics specific to this age group .
Research findings/conclusions	"The second is that the collaborative aspect of information seeking in a forum allows these adolescents to overcome difficulties commonly associated with the search process ( making a precise request , evaluating a result ) ."
Research questions	"However , both computing neurophysiologic responses and retrieving documents are characterized by uncertainty because of noisy signals and incomplete or inconsistent representations of the data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We present the first-of-its-kind , fully integrated information retrieval system that makes use of online implicit relevance feedback generated from brain activity as measured through electroencephalography ( EEG ) , and eye movements ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of the evaluation experiment ( N = 16 ) show that we are able to compute online neurophysiology-based relevance feedback with performance significantly better than chance in complex data domains and realistic search tasks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We contribute by demonstrating how to integrate in interactive intent modeling this inherently noisy implicit relevance feedback combined with scarce explicit feedback .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although experimental measures of task performance did not allow us to demonstrate how the classification outcomes translated into search task performance , the experiment proved that our approach is able to generate relevance feedback from brain signals and eye movements in a realistic scenario , thus providing promising implications for future work in neuroadaptive information retrieval ( IR ) ."
Research questions	"Technical developments in the area of search , such as Google 's Page Rank algorithm , have proved so good at serving relevant results that Internet search has become integrated into daily human activity ."
Research findings/conclusions	One can endlessly explore topics of interest simply by querying and reading through the resulting links .
Research questions	"Yet , although search engines are well known for providing relevant results based on users ' queries , users do not always receive the results they are looking for ."
Research findings/conclusions	Google 's Director of Research describes clickstream evidence of frustrated users repeatedly reformulating queries and searching through page after page of results .
Research findings/conclusions	"Given the general quality of search engine results , one must consider the possibility that the frustrated user 's query is not effective ; that is , it does not describe the essence of the user 's interest ."
Research questions	"Indeed , extensive research into human search behavior has found that humans are not very effective at formulating good search queries that describe what they are interested in ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Ideally , the user should simply point to a portion of text that sparked the user 's interest , and a system should automatically formulate a search query that captures the essence of the text ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we describe an implemented system that provides this capability ."
Research questions	"We first describe how our work differs from existing work in automatic query formulation , and propose a new method for improved quantification of the relevance of candidate search terms drawn from input text using phrase-level analysis ."
Research method	We then propose an implementable method designed to provide relevant queries based on a user 's text input .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We demonstrate the quality of our results and performance of our system through experimental studies .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results demonstrate that our system produces relevant search terms with roughly two-thirds precision and recall compared to search terms selected by experts , and that typical users find significantly more relevant results ( 31 % more relevant ) more quickly ( 64 % faster ) using our system than self-formulated search queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , we show that our implementation can scale to request loads of up to 10 requests per second within current online responsiveness expectations ( < 2-second response times at the highest loads tested ) ."
Research questions	But what is a good weighting scheme ?
Research method	We compare 12 different in-text citation frequency-weighting schemes in the field of library and information science ( LIS ) and explore author citation impact patterns based on their performance in these schemes .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that the ranks of authors vary widely with different weighting schemes that favor or are biased against common citation impact patternssubstantiated , applied , or noted ."
Research findings/conclusions	These variations separate LIS authors quite clearly into groups with these impact patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	"With consensus rank limits , the hard upper and lower bounds for reasonable author ranks that they provide suggest that author citation ranks may be subject to something like an uncertainty principle ."
Research questions	"While humans find it easy to determine that a person named in one story is the same person referenced in a second story , machines rely heavily on crude heuristics such as string matching and stemming to make guesses as to whether nouns are coreferent ."
Research questions	"A key advantage that humans have over machines is the ability to mentally make connections between ideas and , based on these connections , reason how likely two entities are to be the same ."
Research method	"Mirroring this natural thought process , we have created a prototype framework for disambiguating entities that is based on connectedness ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we demonstrate it in the practical application of disambiguating authors across a large set of bibliographic records ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By representing knowledge from the records as edges in a graph between a subject and an object , we believe that the problem of disambiguating entities reduces to the problem of discovering the most strongly connected nodes in a graph ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The knowledge from the records comes in many different forms , such as names of people , date of publication , and themes extracted from the text of the abstract ."
Research method	These different types of knowledge are fused to create the graph required for disambiguation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the resulting graph and framework can be used for more complex operations ."
Research questions	"Using a case study approach , the aim of this study is to investigate what types of sources and channels , with a special emphasis on social processes and structures of information , support collaborative information work , and the emergence of knowledge in a museum environment ."
Research method	The empirical study was conducted using a combination of ethnographic observation of and interviews with staff members at a medium-sized museum in a Nordic country .
Research findings/conclusions	The study shows that much of the daily information work is routinized and infrastructuralized in social information exchange and reproduction of documented information and museum collections .
Research questions	"While data work presents new opportunities for discovery , value creation , and decision making , its emergence also raises significant ethical issues , including those of ownership , privacy , and trust ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article presents a review of data work , and how negotiating a trade-off between its value and risks requires locating its processes within the contexts of its conditions and consequences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These include international , national , and sectoral conditions of law , policy , and regulation at a macro level ; organizational conditions of information and data governance that aim to address the value and risks of data work at a meso level ; along with attention to the everyday contexts of data and information handling by data information and other professionals at a micro level ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In conclusion , a conceptual framework is presented that locates the processes of data work within the matrix of its macro meso and micro conditions , its consequences for individuals , organizations , and society , and the relations between them ."
Research findings/conclusions	Suggestions are given for how research into the study of data work-its value risks and governance- can be advanced by using this framework .
Research questions	"IN refers to a complex concept : at the very initial state of the phenomenon ( that is , at a visceral level ) , even the searcher may not be aware of its existence ."
Research questions	"Thus , despite advances in the past few decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities , we do not fully understand how an IN emerges and how it is physically manifested ."
Research questions	In this article we aim to inform a holistic view of the realization of IN using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
Research method	"We collected new data of brain activity of 24 participants while they formulated and stated a realization of IN in a Question Answering task , focusing on a distributed set of brain regions associated with activities related to IN , found in our previous study ."
Research method	Results of a functional connectivity analysis led us to propose a neuropsychological model of the realization of IN .
Research method	"Our model consists of three components : ( a ) a successful memory retrieval component , ( b ) an information flow regulation component , and ( c ) a high-level perception component ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We believe this study constitutes an important step in unraveling the nature of IN and how to better satisfy IN .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike the majority of approaches in the literature , we use the raw Wikipedia text for knowledge acquisition ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main assumption made is that the concepts classified under the same node in a taxonomy are described in a comparable way in Wikipedia .
Research method	The annotation of the extracted knowledge is done at two levels : ontological and logical .
Research method	"The extracted properties are evaluated in the traditional way , that is , by computing the precision of the extraction procedure and in a clustering task ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The second method of evaluation is seldom used in the natural language processing community , but it is regularly employed in cognitive psychology ."
Research method	"A total of 1,125 Sci-Tech policy-related papers ( 873 journal papers [ 78 % ] , 205 conference papers [ 18 % ] , and 47 review papers [ 4 % ] ) have been retrieved from the Web of Science database for quantitative analysis and mapping ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Different network and contour maps based on these 1,125 papers can be constructed by choosing different information as the main actor , such as the paper title , the institute , the country , or the author keywords , to reflect Sci-Tech policy research structures in micro- , meso- , and macro-levels , respectively ."
Research method	The quantitative way of exploring Sci-Tech policy research papers is investigated to unveil important or emerging Sci-Tech policy implications as well as to demonstrate the dynamics and visualization of the evolution of Sci-Tech policy research .
Research method	"To uncover the differences in English scientific writing between native English-speaking scholars ( NESs ) and NNESs , we collected a large-scale data set containing more than 150,000 full-text articles published in PLoS between 2006 and 2015 ."
Research method	"We divided these articles into three groups according to the ethnic backgrounds of the first and corresponding authors , obtained by Ethnea , and examined the scientific writing styles in English from a two-fold perspective of linguistic complexity : ( a ) syntactic complexity , including measurements of sentence length and sentence complexity ; and ( b ) lexical complexity , including measurements of lexical diversity , lexical density , and lexical sophistication ."
Research findings/conclusions	The observations suggest marginal differences between groups in syntactical and lexical complexity .
Research questions	"Inspired by successful practices in the areas of SERVQUAL , capability-based theories , and IT-related capability management , the efficient delivery of EGS should derive from the high capabilities of a government to provide such services ."
Research questions	This article aims to develop a conceptual framework to assess and empirically examine EGSC using data from local governments in Mainland China .
Research findings/conclusions	The fitness test and the case study prove that the conceptual framework was suitable in analyzing China 's EGSC .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the EGSC can be examined from 3 dimensions/layers : content service capability , service delivery capability , and on-demand capability ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of the structural analysis illustrate the practical management applications of EGSC , which can facilitate the improvement of EGS ."
Research findings/conclusions	The successful transformation of patients from passive recipients to active participants is largely attributed to increased access to healthcare information .
Research findings/conclusions	Online support groups present a platform to seek and exchange information in an inclusive environment .
Research questions	"As the volume of text on online support groups continues to grow exponentially , it is imperative to improve the quality of retrieved information in terms of relevance , reliability , and usefulness ."
Research method	We present a text-mining approach that generates a knowledge extraction layer to address this void in personalized information retrieval from online support groups .
Research method	The knowledge extraction layer encapsulates an ensemble of text-mining techniques with a domain ontology to interpose an investigable and extensible structure on hitherto unstructured text .
Research findings/conclusions	"This structure is not limited to personalized information retrieval for patients , as it also imparts aggregates for crowdsourcing analytics by healthcare researchers ."
Research method	"The proposed approach was successfully trialed on an active online support group consisting of 800,000 posts by 72,066 participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	Demonstrations for both patient and researcher use cases accentuate the value of the proposed approach to unlock a broad spectrum of personalized and aggregate knowledge concealed within crowdsourced content .
Research method	We studied the APCs charged and article volumes of journals that were listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals as charging APCs .
Research method	"These included 1,370 journals that published 100,697 articles in 2010 ."
Research findings/conclusions	The average APC was $ 906 ? U.S .
Research method	dollars ( USD ) calculated over journals and $ 904 USD calculated over articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"The price range varied between $ 8 and $ 3,900 USD , with the lowest prices charged by journals published in developing countries and the highest by journals with high-impact factors from major international publishers ."
Research findings/conclusions	Journals in biomedicine represent 59 % of the sample and 58 % of the total article volume .
Research findings/conclusions	They also had the highest APCs of any discipline .
Research findings/conclusions	"Professionally published journals , both for profit and nonprofit , had substantially higher APCs than journals published by societies , universities , or scholars/researchers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These price estimates are lower than some previous studies of OA publishing and much lower than is generally charged by subscription publishers making individual articles OA in what are termed hybrid journals .
Research questions	"However , because it is jointly written by many contributors , it is subject to constant manipulation by contributors attempting to add biographies of non-notable people ."
Research method	"Over time , Wikipedia has developed inclusion criteria for notable people ( e.g. , receiving a significant award ) based on which newly contributed biographies are evaluated ."
Research method	In this paper we present and analyze a set of simple indicators that can be used to predict which article will eventually be accepted .
Research findings/conclusions	"These indicators do not refer to the content itself , but to meta-content features ( such as the number of categories that the biography is associated with ) and to author-based features ( such as if it is a first-time author ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By training a classifier on these features , we successfully reached a high predictive performance ( area under the receiver operating characteristic [ ROC ] curve [ AUC ] of 0.97 ) even though we overlooked the actual biography text ."
Research questions	"However , the diffusion mechanisms underlying the citation process remain poorly understood , despite the frequent and longstanding use of citation counts for assessment Research questionss within the scientific community ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Here , we extend the study of citation dynamics to a more general diffusion process to understand how citation growth associates with different diffusion patterns ."
Research method	"Using a classic diffusion model , we quantify and illustrate specific diffusion mechanisms which have been proven to exert a significant impact on the growth and decay of citation counts ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments reveal a positive relation between the low p and low q pattern and high scientific impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"A sharp citation peak produced by rapid change of citation counts , however , has a negative effect on future impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , we have suggested a simple indicator , saturation level , to roughly estimate an individual article 's current stage in the life cycle and its potential to attract future attention ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed approach can also be extended to higher levels of aggregation ( e.g. , individual scientists , journals , institutions ) , providing further insights into the practice of scientific evaluation ."
Research method	"We conducted a pilot study to understand the ecosystem in which research software participates , and to identify significant characteristics that have high potential to support future scholarly practices ."
Research method	A set of topical curation dimensions were derived from the extant literature and applied to select cases of institutionally significant research software .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This approach yields our main contribution , a curation model and decision framework for preserving research software as a scholarly object ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of our study highlight the unique characteristics and challenges at play in building curation services in academic research libraries .
Research findings/conclusions	"This is consequential for communities of researchers , educators , and practitioners concerned with studying , supporting , and educating information professionals ."
Research questions	"In the face of new developments in artificial intelligence ( AI ) , the research community faces 3 questions : ( a ) How is AI becoming part of the world of work ?"
Research questions	( b ) How is the world of work becoming part of AI ?
Research questions	and ( c ) How can the information community help address this topic of Work in the Age of Intelligent Machines ( WAIM ) ?
Research method	This opinion piece considers these 3 questions by drawing on discussion from an engaging 2019 iConference workshop organized by the NSF supported WAIM research coordination network ( note : ) .
Research questions	The US National Security Agency ( NSA ) intelligence documents revealed by Edward Snowden in June of 2013 brought the term metadata into the public consciousness .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Surprisingly little discussion in the information sciences has since occurred on the nature and importance of metadata within networked communication systems .
Research questions	The collection of digital metadata impacts the ways that people experience social and technical communication .
Research questions	"Without such metadata , networked communication can not exist ."
Research questions	"The NSA leaks , and numerous recent hacks of corporate and government communications , point to metadata as objects of new scholarly inquiry ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If we are to engage in meaningful discussions about our digital traces , or make informed decisions about new policies and technologies , it is essential to develop theoretical and empirical frameworks that account for digital metadata ."
Research findings/conclusions	This opinion paper presents 5 key sociotechnical characteristics of metadata within digital networks that would benefit from stronger engagement by the information sciences .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Considering how scientific collaboration is actually initiated , this study focuses on the organization and sector levels of international coauthorship networks , going beyond a country-level description ."
Research questions	"Based on a network analysis of coauthorship networks between members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , this study attempts to gain a better understanding of international scientific collaboration by exploring the structure of the coauthorship network in terms of university-industry-government ( UIG ) relationships , the mode of knowledge production , and the underlying dynamic of collaboration in terms of geographic , linguistic , and economic factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that the United States showed overwhelming dominance in all bilateral UIG combinations with the exception of the government-government ( GG ) network .
Research findings/conclusions	"Scientific collaboration within the industry sector was concentrated in a few players , whereas that between the university and industry sectors was relatively less concentrated ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the growing participation from other sectors , universities were still the main locus of knowledge production , with the exception of 5 countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The university sector in English-speaking wealthy countries and the government sector of non-English-speaking , less-wealthy countries played a key role in international collaborations between OECD countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions did not provide evidence supporting the institutional proximity argument .
Research questions	We explore whether the peaks in the spectrograms generated by Reference Publication Years Spectroscopy ( RPYS ) indicate such long-term impact by comparing across RPYS for subsequent time intervals .
Research findings/conclusions	Multi-RPYS enables us to distinguish between short-term citation peaks at the research front that decay within 10 years versus historically constitutive ( long-term ) citations that function as concept symbols .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using these constitutive citations , one is able to cluster document sets ( e.g. , journals ) in terms of intellectually shared histories ."
Research method	We test this premise by clustering 40 journals in the Web of Science Category of Information and Library Science using multi-RPYS .
Research findings/conclusions	"It follows that RPYS can not only be used for retrieving roots of sets under study ( cited ) , but also for algorithmic historiography of the citing sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	Significant references are historically rooted symbols among other citations that function as currency .
Research method	"We present a map of Finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification , and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-a-vis those generated by human reasoning ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that from theoretical and practical perspectives there exist several challenges for human reasoning-based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge , as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge , and can not easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Automated classification schemes , in contrast , generate classification models only from the available text corpus , thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"They also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis , and enable a range of Big Data possibilities ."
Research questions	"However , we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowledge , and we believe that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis ."
Research questions	"This article explores the conceptual frameworks , methods , and data sources used in bibliometrics to study the nature of the humanities , and its differences and similarities in comparison with other scientific domains ."
Research method	We give a historical overview of bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2018 that studies the humanities empirically and distinguishes between two periods in which the configuration of the bibliometric system differs remarkably .
Research method	"The first period , 1965 to the 1980s , is characterized by bibliometric methods embedded in a sociological theoretical framework , the development and use of the Price Index , and small samples of journal publications from which references are used as data sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The second period , the 1980s to the present day , is characterized by a new intellectual hinterland-that of science policy and research evaluation-in which bibliometric methods become embedded ."
Research method	Here metadata of publications becomes the primary data source with which publication profiles of humanistic scholarly communities are analyzed .
Research questions	We unpack the differences between these two periods and critically discuss the analytical avenues that different approaches offer .
Research questions	We believe that in this astonishing historical moment of new directions and new opportunities both the existing paradigms and conceptual models in the field of information can benefit from re-examination to stay current with the times .
Research method	"We propose a framework articulating key narratives associated with the why , what , how , and who dimensions to discuss paradigm shift ( s ) ."
Research questions	The Research questions of this opinion paper is to initiate dialogues on ground-breaking ideas and innovative solutions as well as support research that addresses contemporary challenges in the field of information .
Research method	PPA is compared with the Thomson-Reuters Institute for Scientific Information ( TR ) 5-year and 2-year impact factors and with expert opinion .
Research findings/conclusions	"The ranking produced by the method under study is only partially correlated with citation-based measures ( TR ) , but exhibits close agreement with expert survey rankings ."
Research findings/conclusions	A simple average of TR and power rankings results in a new ranking that is highly correlated with the expert survey rankings .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This evidence suggests that power ranking can contribute to evaluating artificial intelligence journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , papers now can be read and cited based on their own merits , independently of the journal 's physical availability , reputation , or impact factor ( IF ) ."
Research method	We compare the strength of the relationship between journals ' IFs and the actual citations received by their respective papers from 1902 to 2009 .
Research questions	"Throughout most of the 20th century , papers ' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals ' IFs ."
Research questions	"However , since 1990 , the advent of the digital age , the relation between IFs and paper citations has been weakening ."
Research questions	"This began first in physics , a field that was quick to make the transition into the electronic domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , since 1990 the overall proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing and , of these highly cited papers , the proportion not coming from highly cited journals has been increasing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Should this pattern continue , it might bring an end to the use of the IF as a way to evaluate the quality of journals , papers , and researchers ."
Research questions	"Citations are relevant as potential evidence in appointment and promotion decisions , but it is unclear whether there have been historical gender differences in average citation impact that might explain the current shortfall of senior female academics ."
Research method	"This study investigates the evolution of gender differences in citation impact 1996-2018 for six million articles from seven large English-speaking nations : Australia , Canada , Ireland , Jamaica , New Zealand , UK , and the USA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that a small female citation advantage has been the norm over time for all these countries except the USA , where there has been no practical difference ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The female citation advantage is largest , and statistically significant in most years , for Australia and the UK ."
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests that any academic bias against citing female-authored research can not explain current employment inequalities .
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , comparisons using recent citation data , or avoiding it altogether , during appointments or promotion may disadvantage females in some countries by underestimating the likely greater impact of their work , especially in the long term ."
Research findings/conclusions	Browsing by category is rarely supported .
Research questions	"Although helpful machine-learning methods have been applied successfully to similar situations for English news articles , limited research has been completed to yield suitable solutions for Arabic news ."
Research method	"In connection with a Qatar National Research Fund ( QNRF ) -funded project to build digital library community and infrastructure in Qatar , we developed software for browsing a collection of about 237,000 Arabic news articles , which should be applicable to other Arabic news collections ."
Research method	"We designed a simple taxonomy for Arabic news stories that is suitable for the needs of Qatar and other nations , is compatible with the subject codes of the International Press Telecommunications Council , and was enhanced with the aid of a librarian expert as well as five Arabic-speaking volunteers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We developed tailored stemming ( i.e. , a new Arabic light stemmer called P-Stemmer ) and automatic classification methods ( the best being binary Support Vector Machines classifiers ) to work with the taxonomy ."
Research method	"Using evaluation techniques commonly used in the information retrieval community , including 10-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test , we showed that our approach to stemming and classification is superior to state-of-the-art techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , it is not clear whether this citation advantage is the result of higher quality research or due to other factors , such as a larger audience for the publications ."
Research questions	"To test whether the apparent advantage of internationally collaborative research may be due to additional interest in articles from the countries of the authors , this article assesses the extent to which the national affiliations of the authors of articles affect the national affiliations of their Mendeley readers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on English-language Web of Science articles in 10 fields from science , medicine , social science , and the humanities , the results of statistical models comparing author and reader affiliations suggest that , in most fields , Mendeley users are disproportionately readers of articles authored from within their own country ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , there are several cases in which Mendeley users from certain countries tend to ignore articles from specific other countries , although it is not clear whether this reflects national biases or different national specialisms within a field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In conclusion , research funders should not incentivize international collaboration on the basis that it is , in general , higher quality because its higher impact may be primarily due to its larger audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , authors should guard against national biases in their reading to select only the best and most relevant publications to inform their research ."
Research questions	"Images are increasingly ubiquitous in daily communication due to advances in visually enabled information and communication technologies ( ICT ) , such as information visualization applications , image retrieval systems , and virtual collaborative work tools ."
Research questions	"Although images are often used in social contexts , information science research concerned with the visual representation of information typically focuses on the image artifact and system building ."
Research method	"To learn more about image making as a form of social interaction and as a form of information practice , a qualitative study examined face-to-face conversations involving the creation of ad hoc visualizations ( i.e. , napkin drawings ) ."
Research method	Interactional sociolinguistic concepts of conversational involvement and coordination guided multimodal analysis of video-recorded interactions that included spontaneous drawing .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions show patterns in communicative activities associated with the visual representation of information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the activity of mark making contributes to the maintenance of conversational involvement in ways that are not always evident in the drawn artifact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This research has implications for the design and evaluation of visually enabled virtual collaboration environments , visual information extraction and retrieval systems , and data visualization tools ."
Research questions	"One of these repositories , Wikipedia , is facing an important problem : assessing the quality of Wikipedia ."
Research method	Existing approaches exploit techniques such as statistical models or machine leaning algorithms to assess Wikipedia article quality .
Research questions	"However , existing models do not provide satisfactory results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , these models fail to adopt a comprehensive feature framework ."
Research method	"In this article , we conduct an extensive survey of previous studies and summarize a comprehensive feature framework , including text statistics , writing style , readability , article structure , network , and editing history ."
Research method	"Selected state-of-the-art deep-learning models , including the convolutional neural network ( CNN ) , deep neural network ( DNN ) , long short-term memory ( LSTMs ) network , CNN-LSTMs , bidirectional LSTMs , and stacked LSTMs , are applied to assess the quality of Wikipedia ."
Research method	A detailed comparison of deep-learning models is conducted with regard to different aspects : classification performance and training performance .
Research method	We include an importance analysis of different features and feature sets to determine which features or feature sets are most effective in distinguishing Wikipedia article quality .
Research findings/conclusions	This extensive experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed model .
Research findings/conclusions	One topic discussed vehemently online that could benefit from this type of analysis is vaccines .
Research method	We carried out a study analyzing the web presence of both sides of this debate .
Research method	We collected a variety of webometric data and analyzed the data both quantitatively and qualitatively .
Research findings/conclusions	The study found far more anti- than pro-vaccine web domains .
Research findings/conclusions	The anti and pro sides had similar web visibility as measured by the number of links coming from general websites and Tweets .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the links to the pro domains were of higher quality measured by PageRank scores ."
Research findings/conclusions	The result from the qualitative content analysis confirmed this finding .
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis of site ages revealed that the battle between the two sides had a long history and is still ongoing .
Research findings/conclusions	The web scene was polarized with either pro or anti views and little neutral ground .
Research findings/conclusions	The study suggests ways that professional information can be promoted more effectively on the web .
Research findings/conclusions	The study demonstrates that webometrics analysis is effective in studying online information dissemination .
Research findings/conclusions	This kind of analysis can be used to study not only health information but other information as well .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , practitioners and researchers alike need a better understanding of what outcome they can reasonably expect of the reconciliation process between their local metadata and established controlled vocabularies which are already a part of the Linked Data cloud ."
Research method	This paper offers an in-depth analysis of how a locally developed vocabulary can be successfully reconciled with the Library of Congress Subject Headings ( LCSH ) and the Arts and Architecture Thesaurus ( AAT ) through the help of a general-Research questions tool for interactive data transformation ( OpenRefine ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Issues negatively affecting the reconciliation process are identified and solutions are proposed in order to derive maximum value from existing metadata and controlled vocabularies in an automated manner .
Research questions	Predicting a user 's knowledge level from implicit evidence such as search behaviors could allow an adaptive information retrieval system to better personalize its interaction with users .
Research method	This study examines whether user domain knowledge can be predicted from search behaviors by applying a regression modeling analysis method .
Research method	We identify behavioral features that contribute most to a successful prediction model .
Research method	A user experiment was conducted with 40 participants searching on task topics in the domain of genomics .
Research method	Participant domain knowledge level was assessed based on the users ' familiarity with and expertise in the search topics and their knowledge of MeSH ( Medical Subject Headings ) terms in the categories that corresponded to the search topics .
Research method	"Users ' search behaviors were captured by logging software , which includes querying behaviors , document selection behaviors , and general task interaction behaviors ."
Research method	Multiple regression analysis was run on the behavioral data using different variable selection methods .
Research findings/conclusions	"Four successful predictive models were identified , each involving a slightly different set of behavioral variables ."
Research method	"The models were compared for the best on model fit , significance of the model , and contributions of individual predictors in each model ."
Research method	Each model was validated using the split sampling method .
Research findings/conclusions	"The final model highlights three behavioral variables as domain knowledge level predictors : the number of documents saved , the average query length , and the average ranking position of the documents opened ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results are discussed , study limitations are addressed , and future research directions are suggested ."
Research questions	"The literature is unclear , however , about the relationship between the size of crowds and its impact on outcomes ."
Research method	"To better understand the effects of crowd size we conducted a study on the retention and performance based on 4,317 articles in the WikiProject Film community ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results suggest that crowds benefit from their size when they are diverse , experienced , and have low retention rates ."
Research method	"Our hypothesis was that DSQ are distinct and complementary dimensions , in opposition to the overlapping of DSQ proposed in the SERVQUAL and LibQUAL+ ( R ) models ."
Research questions	"In addition , the influence of PSQ on user loyalty ( UL ) was investigated ."
Research method	"Using structural equation modeling , we analyzed the survey data of 1,028 users of a network of academic libraries and report 2 main Research findings/conclusions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , it was shown that the 10 DSQ are statistically significant for the evaluation of PSQ ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we demonstrated the positive effect of PSQ for UL ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The model presented may be used as a diagnostic and benchmarking tool for managers , coordinators , and librarians who seek to evaluate and/or assess the quality of the services offered by their libraries , as well as to identify and/or manage the loyalty level of their users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The number of retractions each year has also increased tremendously , especially in the biomedical field , and scientific misconduct accounts for more than half of those retractions ."
Research questions	"It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues ' misconduct , and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors ' research careers ."
Research method	"Using data from the Web of Science , we measured the productivity , impact , and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted articles for a period of 5 years before and after the retraction ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues ' misconduct and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted paper , being felt most strongly by first authors , followed by the last authors , with the impact is less important for middle authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By using a worldwide survey among demographers in developed and developing countries , the authors show that the large majority perceive the publication pressure as high , but more so in Anglo-Saxon countries and to a lesser extent in Western Europe ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , scholars see both the pros ( upward mobility ) and cons ( excessive publication and uncitedness , neglect of policy issues , etc . )"
Research questions	of the so-called publish-or-perish culture .
Research findings/conclusions	"By measuring behavior in terms of reading and publishing , and perceived extrinsic rewards and stated intrinsic rewards of practicing science , it turns out that publication pressure negatively affects the orientation of demographers towards policy and knowledge sharing ."
Research findings/conclusions	There are no signs that the pressure affects reading and publishing outside the core discipline .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Prior work has used such embeddings to identify shifts in the meaning of individual words .
Research questions	"However , simply knowing that a word has changed in meaning is insufficient to identify the instances of word usage that convey the historical meaning or the newer meaning ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this study , we link diachronic word embeddings to documents , by situating those documents as leaders or laggards with respect to ongoing semantic changes ."
Research questions	"Specifically , we propose a novel method to quantify the degree of semantic progressiveness in each word usage , and then show how these usages can be aggregated to obtain scores for each document ."
Research method	"We analyze two large collections of documents , representing legal opinions and scientific articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Documents that are scored as semantically progressive receive a larger number of citations , indicating that they are especially influential ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our work thus provides a new technique for identifying lexical semantic leaders and demonstrates a new link between progressive use of language and influence in a citation network .
Research findings/conclusions	This framework provides a method to describe precisely aspects of privacy and context and a flexible vocabulary and notation for such descriptions and comparisons .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it links philosophical and conceptual work on privacy to social science and policy work and accommodates different conceptions of the nature and value of privacy ."
Research questions	The article begins with an outline of the framework .
Research method	It then refines the view by describing a hypothetical application .
Research method	"Finally , it applies the framework to a real-world privacy issue-campaign finance disclosure laws in the United States and France ."
Research questions	The article concludes with an argument that the framework offers important advantages to privacy scholarship and for privacy policy makers .
Research method	"Using the methods described in this article , we provide Eigenfactor rankings for 84,808 disambiguated authors of 240,804 papers in the Social Science Research Network ( SSRN ) a preprint and postprint archive devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As an additive metric , the Eigenfactor scores are readily computed for collectives such as departments or institutions as well ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that a collective 's Eigenfactor score can be computed either by summing the Eigenfactor scores of its members or by working directly with a collective-level cross-citation matrix .
Research method	We provide Eigenfactor rankings for institutions and countries in the SSRN repository .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"With a network-wide comparison of Eigenfactor scores and download tallies , we demonstrate that Eigenfactor scores provide information that is both different from and complementary to that provided by download counts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We see author-level ranking as one filter for navigating the scholarly literature , and note that such rankings generate incentives for more open scholarship , because authors are rewarded for making their work available to the community as early as possible and before formal publication ."
Research method	"We explore the directions and the evolution of evaluation research for the period 2001-2011 by studying the evaluation initiatives presented at 2 main conferences of the digital library domain , namely the Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( ACM/IEEE ) Joint Conference on Digital Libraries ( JCDL ) , and the European Conference on Digital Libraries ( ECDL ; since 2011 renamed to the International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries [ TPDL ] ) ."
Research method	"The literature is annotated using a domain ontology , named DiLEO , which defines explicitly the main concepts of the digital library evaluation domain and their correlations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The ontology instances constitute a semantic network that enables the uniform and formal representation of the critical evaluation constructs in both conferences , untangles their associations , and supports the study of their evolution ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss interesting patterns in the evaluation practices as well as in the research foci of the 2 venues , and outline current research trends and areas for further research ."
Research questions	"In this article , we study the generation of query-biased summaries as a sentence ranking approach , and methods to evaluate their effectiveness ."
Research method	"Using sentence-level relevance assessments from the TREC Novelty track , we gauge the benefits of query expansion to minimize the vocabulary mismatch problem between informational requests and sentence ranking methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results from an intrinsic evaluation show that query expansion significantly improves the selection of short relevant sentences ( 5-13 words ) between 7 % and 11 % .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , query expansion does not lead to improvements for sentences of medium ( 14-20 words ) and long ( 21-29 words ) lengths ."
Research method	"In a separate crowdsourcing study , we analyze whether a summary composed of sentences ranked using query expansion was preferred over summaries not assisted by query expansion , rather than assessing sentences individually ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that participants chose summaries aided by query expansion around 60 % of the time over summaries using an unexpanded query .
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that query expansion techniques can benefit the selection of sentences for the construction of query-biased summaries at the summary level rather than at the sentence ranking level .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This brief communication examines the basis for such beliefs and finds it wanting .
Research findings/conclusions	"Indeed , in this study of over 9,000 OA journals included in the Directory of Open Access Journals , only 28 % charged authors for publishing in their journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This figure , however , was highest in various disciplines in medicine ( 47 % ) and the sciences ( 43 % ) and lowest in the humanities ( 4 % ) and the arts ( 0 % ) ."
Research method	Research questions included what content is communicated between the child and the tablet computer and how engaged are children in the interaction .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that mathematics applications developers have focused on creating applications for the practice of a priori knowledge , rather than on creating instructional applications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show preliminary evidence that child-tablet communication is generally successful , but this success comes at the cost of richer , multimodal interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Tablet computer application developers are being cautious in offering a variety of options for children to interact with the devices , and we suggest that there is scope for a broadening of communicative interaction modes ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study integrates attitude and identity theory within a cross-sectional survey design .
Research method	"The sample consists of about 1,600 researchers in Norway , and the data were collected via e-mail invitation using a digital surveying tool and analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We determined that perceived impact-quality increases the intention to publish non-OA , while decreasing the intention to publish OA ."
Research findings/conclusions	Content quality is only associated with non-OA journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Perceived visibility increases the intention to publish OA , while the opposite effect is found for non-OA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Career-self salience has the strongest effect on impact-quality , while content quality is most important when work-self is salient ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research contributes to a deeper understanding about how perceived quality influences intention to publish in OA and non-OA journals , and how self-identity salience affects different facets of perceived quality in valence and strength ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions have implications for policy development , implementation , and assessment and may contribute to improving OA adoption ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Given its radical departure from previous encyclopedias , it is not surprising that it is controversial ."
Research questions	"Wikipedia is freely editable , leading to debates over accuracy and writing style ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It has also included topics , especially in the area of popular culture , which some believe are not appropriate for a serious , comprehensive encyclopedia ."
Research questions	"In this article , I do not examine these arguments , but , rather , a different problem confronting Wikipedia ."
Research method	"Through a case study of Cambodian history articles , I demonstrate how Wikipedia limits itself through a largely unconscious appropriation of the dominant discourse of representation surrounding its objects of inquiry ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When article quality is examined , a distinct pattern emerges that can readily be matched to the dominant historiographical tradition of Cambodian history ."
Research questions	"As well as presenting this case study as a demonstration of the influence of dominant discursive narratives , I wish to contextualize this privileging of particular discourses within debates about the New World Information and Communication Order ( NWICO ) that emerged in the 1970s ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	I argue that the NWICO can be useful in our thinking about the relationship of information professionals to Wikipedia today .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Interestingly , in the business domain , the text mining and machine learning community has minimally explored company annual reports with their mandatory disclosures ."
Research questions	"In this study , we explore the question How can annual reports be used to predict change in company performance from one year to the next ?"
Research value/outlook/limitations	from a text mining perspective .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our article contributes a systematic study of the potential of company mandatory disclosures using a computational viewpoint in the following aspects : ( a ) We characterize our research problem along distinct dimensions to gain a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the capacity of supervised learning methods in predicting change in company performance using annual reports , and ( b ) our Research findings/conclusions from unbiased systematic experiments provide further evidence about the economic incentives faced by analysts in their stock recommendations and speculations on analysts having access to more information in producing earnings forecast ."
Research method	"We present a study , involving interviews ( n= 43 ) and ethnographic observation , of how two libraries partnered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) to curate a significant astronomy dataset ."
Research method	"Each library took different decisions : one library assigned activities to a unit specializing in digital curation , while the other distributed activities across its existing units ."
Research findings/conclusions	Neither approach proved a silver bullet .
Research findings/conclusions	"While library staff members felt the outcomes largely met their expectations , SDSS leaders expressed mixed opinions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We identify three factors that contributed to these differences in perspective : differing strategic motivations for undertaking this Data Transfer Process , SDSS leaders ' misperceptions about libraries , and organizational mismatches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These factors contributed to four differences in perspective between SDSS leaders and library staff : provenance as technical information or as information about social context , dataset as a live research object or as a static object to be preserved , systems and services tailored to the dataset or easily adaptable to other datasets , and obstacles as setbacks or as opportunities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Only those differences that emerged when SDSS collaboration members and library staff communicated frequently were resolved .
Research method	"The data analysis in the study was divided into 3 phases : analysis of indexing consistency , analysis of tagging effectiveness , and analysis of the semantic values of tags ."
Research method	"To analyze indexing consistency , this study employed the vector space model-based indexing consistency measures ."
Research method	An analysis of tagging effectiveness with tagging exhaustivity and tag specificity was conducted to ameliorate the drawbacks of consistency analysis based on only the quantitative measures of vocabulary matching .
Research method	"To further investigate the semantic values of tags at various levels of specificity , a latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) was conducted ."
Research method	"To test statistical significance for the relation between tag specificity and semantic quality , correlation analysis was conducted ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research demonstrates the potential of tags for web document indexing with a complete assessment of tagging quality and provides a basis for further study of the strengths and limitations of tagging .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results , based on statistical analyses of a population-based survey ( N ? = ? 616 ) conducted in Finland , indicate that health information behavior is influenced by an individual 's stage of change in the context of physical activity and exercise ."
Research questions	"In pre-action stages ( precontemplation , contemplation , preparation ) where individuals do not exercise regularly and are uninformed or lack motivation , commitment , or skills to change behaviors , information is most often encountered through the passive practice of nondirected monitoring ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the action stage , where individuals have recently changed their exercise behaviors , information is obtained most frequently by active seeking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the maintenance stage , where individuals maintain earlier adopted behaviors , information is habitually obtained through active scanning ."
Research findings/conclusions	These results support the TTM in its postulation that individuals may benefit from stage-tailored health-communication strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The limitations of this study include self-reported behaviors , cross-sectional study design , and a possibly biased sample ."
Research findings/conclusions	Further research is needed to explore the role of information behavior in the process of behavior change in greater detail .
Research method	I apply standard information retrieval techniques to build a list of the most frequent terms in each set of definitions .
Research method	I then apply information extraction techniques to analyze how the top terms are used in the definitions .
Research method	"As a result , I draw data-driven conclusions about the aggregate opinion of the experts ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	I contrast this with the original analysis of the data to provide readers with an alternative viewpoint on what the data tell us .
Research questions	"The teams use information and computing technologies ( ICTs ) to communicate between team members , who originate from different cultures using different languages ."
Research questions	This paper investigates the usability and utility of a range of ICTs used for communication between team members from different cultures .
Research method	"The research used an intercultural heuristic evaluation tool , or I-CHET , to evaluate nine ICTs used by Australian and Lao scientists for team communication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The evaluation showed that asynchronous ICTs ( e.g. , e-mail ) were preferred by non-native English speakers , while synchronous media ( e.g. , audio conferencing , instant messaging , Skype ) presented considerable problems between team members from different cultures ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most ICTs evaluated in the study demonstrated little consideration for non-native English speakers and for inexperienced ICTs users .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , all evaluated ICTs demonstrated the ability to transmit information and encourage communication between information users in scientific collaborations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The I-CHET assessment tool highlights the ongoing need for a tool-box of communication ICTs for research collaborations that can be adapted to suit the cultural and professional needs of multinational teams , worldwide ."
Research questions	"However , current methods in role analysis have overlooked content generated by users ( e.g. , posts ) in social media and hence focus more on user behavior analysis ."
Research questions	The user-generated content is very important for characterizing users .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper , we propose a novel method which integrates both user behavior and posted content by users to identify roles in online social networks ."
Research method	"The proposed method models a role as a joint distribution of Gaussian distribution and multinomial distribution , which represent user behavioral feature and content feature respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed method can be used to determine the number of roles concerned automatically .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to identify various roles more effectively and to get more insights on such characteristics .
Research questions	"The article begins with an overview of Rawls 's work , paying particular attention to its foundations and methods ."
Research method	"Subsequently , a 2-phase discussion of the literature is presented ."
Research method	"The first phase reviews engagements with Rawls from more than 150 scholarly articles from databases and journals dedicated to information and technology ethics , information/technology studies , philosophy of technology , and technology and human values ."
Research method	The second phase focuses on scholars who have demonstrated a significant commitment to Rawlsian theory in these areas .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the review demonstrates that most significant applications of Rawls are oriented toward unequal distributions of informational goods exacerbated by advanced information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) ."
Research questions	"Critically , however , scholars in this area have overlooked the relevance of Rawls 's foundations for the sorts of complex networked relationships afforded by those same advanced ICTs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Rather than representing a fatal gap , it opens up a new avenue for the renewed consideration of Rawlshis ideas on the basic structure of society and the importance of self-respect are offered as 2 possible paths forward ."
Research questions	"Done under the banner of learning analytics , this work can-and often does-surface sensitive data and information about , inter alia , a student 's demographics , academic performance , offline and online movements , physical fitness , mental wellbeing , and social network ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With these data , institutions and third parties are able to describe student life , predict future behaviors , and intervene to address academic or other barriers to student success ( however defined ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Learning analytics , consequently , raise serious issues concerning student privacy , autonomy , and the appropriate flow of student data ."
Research questions	"We argue that issues around privacy lead to valid questions about the degree to which students should trust their institution to use learning analytics data and other artifacts ( algorithms , predictive scores ) with their interests in mind ."
Research questions	We argue that higher education institutions are paradigms of information fiduciaries .
Research questions	"As such , colleges and universities have a special responsibility to their students ."
Research questions	"In this article , we use the information fiduciary concept to analyze cases when learning analytics violate an institution 's responsibility to its students ."
Research method	"Our approach is to set up a traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university department is determined by a panel of experts , but a citation metric is regarded as a reasonable proxy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the model assumes that the information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds that contained in a citation metric ( HEFCE , 2015 ) ."
Research method	"Finally , we extend this model by including altmetric data to see if it adds information about a department 's performance that can not be gleaned from citations alone ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning research to be highly correlated with peer review scores for societal impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , no such connection was seen with the assessment of research quality ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions therefore suggest altmetric data could be useful as an aid to assessing impact .
Research questions	"With the explosive growth of web documents , sentiment analysis is becoming a hot topic in both academic research and system design ."
Research method	"Fine-grained sentiment analysis is traditionally solved as a 2-step strategy , which results in cascade errors ."
Research questions	"Although joint models , such as joint sentiment/topic and maximum entropy ( MaxEnt ) /latent Dirichlet allocation , are proposed to tackle this problem of sentiment analysis , they focus on the joint learning of both aspects and sentiments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , they are not appropriate to solve the cascade errors for sentiment analysis at the sentence or subsentence level ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we present a novel jointly fine-grained sentiment analysis framework at the subsentence level with Markov logic ."
Research method	"First , we divide the task into 2 separate stages ( subjectivity classification and polarity classification ) ."
Research method	"Then , the 2 separate stages are processed , respectively , with different feature sets , which are implemented by local formulas in Markov logic ."
Research method	"Finally , global formulas in Markov logic are adopted to realize the interactions of the 2 separate stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	The joint inference of subjectivity and polarity helps prevent cascade errors .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments on a Chinese sentiment data set manifest that our joint model brings significant improvements .
Research questions	"However , it is not always easy to find the desired information and in clinical routine the time to fulfil an information need is often very limited ."
Research questions	Information retrieval systems are a useful tool to provide access to these documents/images in the biomedical literature related to information needs of medical professionals .
Research findings/conclusions	Shangri-La is a medical retrieval system that can potentially help clinicians to make decisions on difficult cases .
Research method	It retrieves articles from the biomedical literature when querying a case description and attached images .
Research method	The system is based on a multimodal retrieval approach with a focus on the integration of visual information connected to text .
Research method	The approach includes a query-adaptive multimodal fusion criterion that analyses if visual features are suitable to be fused with text for the retrieval .
Research method	"Furthermore , image modality information is integrated in the retrieval step ."
Research method	The approach is evaluated using the ImageCLEFmed 2013 medical retrieval benchmark and can thus be compared to other approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	Results show that the final approach outperforms the best multimodal approach submitted to ImageCLEFmed 2013 .
Research questions	"Although the evidence that shelf browsing is an important part of information behavior is increasing , information browsing as a behavior is somewhat of a black box ( in contrast to web browsing , which is relatively well understood ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It seems likely from early work that browsing is not , in fact , a monolithic behavior , but rather a set of behaviors and goals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The typologies presented in these works , however , are of a too high level to offer much insight into what support is needed for successful online browsing ."
Research questions	"In contrast , a recent spate of speculative browsing technologies meet some browsing needs , but offer little theoretical understanding of how systems support browsing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The major contribution of this article is a new typology of library browsing behavior based on recent observations of browsing behavior in libraries .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The secondary contribution is an understanding of the interface features that would support these types of information browsers in an online environment .
Research method	Half a million units of data at firm level in 2011 were obtained from the Orbis database of Bureau Van Dijk .
Research method	"The firm level data were aggregated at the levels of 8 Federal Districts , the regional level of 83 Federal Subjects , and the single level of the Russian Federation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Not surprisingly , the knowledge base of the economy is concentrated in the Moscow region ( 22.8 % ) and Saint Petersburg ( 4.0 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Except in Moscow itself , high-tech manufacturing does not add synergy to any other unit at any of the various levels of geographical granularity ; instead it disturbs regional coordination ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Knowledge-intensive services ( KIS ; including laboratories ) contribute to the synergy in all Federal Districts ( except the North-Caucasian Federal District ) , but only in 30 of the 83 Federal Subjects ."
Research findings/conclusions	The synergy in KIS is concentrated in centers of administration .
Research findings/conclusions	"The knowledge-intensive services ( which are often state affiliated ) provide backbone to an emerging knowledge-based economy at the level of Federal Districts , but the economy is otherwise not knowledge based ( except for the Moscow region ) ."
Research questions	"Nevertheless , despite evidence of gender influences within the site for some topics , the extent to which YouTube reflects or promotes male/female or other gender divides is unknown ."
Research method	"This article analyses 10,211 YouTube videos published in 12 months from 2014 to 2015 using commenter-portrayed genders ( inferred from usernames ) and view counts from the end of 2019 ."
Research method	Nonbinary genders are omitted for methodological reasons .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there were highly male and female topics or themes ( e.g. , vehicles or beauty ) and male or female gendering is the norm , videos with topics attracting both males and females tended to have more viewers ( after approximately 5 years ) than videos in male or female gendered topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Similarly , within each topic , videos with gender balanced sets of commenters tend to attract more viewers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , YouTube does not seem to be driving male-female gender differences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is , however , limited , as it assumes all citations are of similar value and weights each equally ."
Research questions	Content-based citation analysis ( CCA ) addresses a citation 's value by interpreting each one based on its context at both the syntactic and semantic levels .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper provides a comprehensive overview of CAA research in terms of its theoretical foundations , methodical approaches , and example applications ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , we highlight how increased computational capabilities and publicly available full-text resources have opened this area of research to vast possibilities , which enable deeper citation analysis , more accurate citation prediction , and increased knowledge discovery ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Being contrary to intuition , the law was forgotten as a mere curious observation ."
Research questions	"However , in the last two decades relevant literature has grown exponentially-an evolution typical of Sleeping Beauties ( SBs ) publications that go unnoticed ( sleep ) for a long time and then suddenly become the center of attention ( are awakened ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , in the present study , we show that the two papers , Newcomb ( 1881 ) and Benford ( 1938 ) , Newcomb ( 1881 , American Journal of Mathematics , 4 , 39-40 ) and Benford ( 1938 , Proc ."
Research questions	Am .
Research questions	Phil .
Research findings/conclusions	"Soc. , 78 , 551-572 ) papers are clearly SBs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The former was in a deep sleep for 110 years , whereas the latter was in a deep sleep for a comparatively lesser period of 31 years up to 1968 , and in a state of less deep sleep for another 27 years , up to 1995 ."
Research method	"Both SBs were awakened in the year 1995 by Hill ( 1995a , Statistical Science , 10 , 354-363 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In so doing , we show that the waking prince ( Hill , 1995a ) is more often quoted than the SB whom he kissed-in this Benford 's law case , wondering whether this is a general effect-to be usefully studied ."
Research findings/conclusions	This approach enables relevance or pseudo-relevance feedback to be incorporated within the language modeling framework of IR .
Research method	"In the traditional RM , the feedback information is used to improve the estimate of the query language model ."
Research method	"In this article , we introduce an extension of RM in the setting of relevance feedback ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our method provides an additional way to incorporate feedback via the improvement of the document language models .
Research method	"Specifically , we make use of the context information of known relevant and nonrelevant documents to obtain weighted counts of query terms for estimating the document language models ."
Research method	The context information is based on the words ( unigrams or bigrams ) appearing within a text window centered on query terms .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments on several Text REtrieval Conference ( TREC ) collections show that our context-dependent relevance model can improve retrieval performance over the baseline RM .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Together with previous studies within the BM25 framework , our current study demonstrates that the effectiveness of our method for using context information in IR is quite general and not limited to any specific retrieval model ."
Research questions	"However , the large volumes and variety of expressions on social media have challenged traditional policy analysis and public sentiment assessment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this article , we describe a framework for social-media-based public policy informatics and a system called iMood that addresses the needs for sentiment and network analyses of U.S. immigration and border security ."
Research method	"iMood collects related messages on Twitter , extracts user sentiment and emotion , and constructs networks of the Twitter users , helping policy makers to identify opinion leaders , influential users , and community activists ."
Research method	"We evaluated the sentiment , emotion , and network characteristics found in 909,035 tweets posted by over 300,000 users during three phases between May and November 2013 ."
Research findings/conclusions	Statistical analyses reveal significant differences in emotion and sentiment among the 3 phases .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Twitter networks of the 3 phases also had significantly different relationship counts , network densities , and total influence scores from those of other phases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This research should contribute to developing a new framework and a new system for social-media-based public policy informatics , providing new empirical Research findings/conclusions and data sets of sentiment and network analyses of U.S. immigration and border security , and demonstrating a general applicability to different domains ."
Research questions	"Although many researchers have attempted to explain why and how people use this new medium , previous studies have produced relatively inconclusive results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"For instance , in most of these studies , microblogging has been considered a social networking activity ; however , quantitative analyses of microblogging usage have shown that people use microblogging as an information-broadcasting platform ."
Research questions	"In this study , we identified the factors that drive microblogging and which of them lead to user satisfaction ."
Research method	We developed a theoretical framework and then empirically validated the factors and the emergent mechanisms ( value evaluation processes ) .
Research method	"We empirically tested our research model using a sample of 230 microbloggers , and the results showed that content and technology gratifications are the two key factors that drive user satisfaction with microblogging ."
Research findings/conclusions	"That is , it is the value of information dissemination rather than social networking that makes people feel satisfied with the use of microblogging ."
Research findings/conclusions	We believe that this study will generate interest among researchers in social media .
Research findings/conclusions	The results also provide platform administrators with insights into how people use microblogging and why they are satisfied with the technology .
Research questions	Yet the literature has not adequately considered the disparate social processes by which texts are produced .
Research questions	"Drawing on communication theory , we identify three common processes by which documents might be detectably similar in their textual featuresauthors sharing subject matter , sharing goals , and sharing sources ."
Research questions	"We hypothesize that these processes produce distinct , detectable relationships between authors in different kinds of textual overlap ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We develop a novel n-gram extraction technique to capture such signatures based on n-grams of different lengths .
Research method	We test the hypothesis on a corpus where the author attributes are observable : the public statements of the members of the U.S. Congress .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents the first empirical finding that shows different social relationships are detectable through the structure of overlapping textual features .
Research findings/conclusions	Our study has important implications for designing text modeling techniques to make sense of social phenomena from aggregate digital traces .
Research method	This article specifically examines the project 's gathered data on creative writing faculty from North American institutions who were surveyed and interviewed about online poetry publishing as both creators and consumers of the literary works .
Research questions	"This study also explores creative writing faculty members ' opinions about publishing in online literary publications in regard to career impact , including tenure and promotion ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As online literary publishing disrupts what continues to be a very print-oriented practice , Rogers ' diffusion of innovations provides a useful framework for exploring these issues ."
Research method	"Because this project considers how innovations diffuse throughout a specific group of artists and scholars , and the information needs that emerge from these transformations , the concept of communities of practice also informed data analysis ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To understand the influence of online reviews , this study extends prior research on information adoption by incorporating the perspective of herd behavior ."
Research method	We develop and empirically test a research model using data collected from an existing book review site .
Research findings/conclusions	We report 2 major Research findings/conclusions .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , argument quality and source credibility predict information usefulness , which affects the adoption of online reviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we determine that the adoption of online reviews is also influenced by 2 herd factors , namely , discounting own information and imitating others ."
Research questions	"We further identify the key determinants of these herd factors , including background homophily and attitude homophily ."
Research findings/conclusions	The theoretical and practical implications are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"Two approaches for making use of this evidence include fusing search results from an anchor text representation and the original text representation based on a document 's relevance score or rank position , and combining term frequency from both representations during the retrieval process ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although these approaches have each been tested and compared against baselines , different evaluations have used different baselines ; no consistent work enables rigorous cross-comparison between these methods ."
Research questions	The Research questions of this work is threefold .
Research method	"First , we survey existing fusion methods of using anchor text in search ."
Research questions	"Second , we compare these methods with common testbeds and web search tasks , with the aim of identifying the most effective fusion method ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Third , we try to correlate search performance with the characteristics of a test collection ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our experimental results show that the best performing method in each category can significantly improve search results over a common baseline .
Research questions	"However , there is no single technique that consistently outperforms competing approaches across different collections and search tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We identify 4 criteria that are relevant for evaluating the quality of knowledge worker support : context relevance , document relevance , prediction of user action , and diversity of the suggestions ."
Research method	We compare 3 different context-aware recommendation methods for information re-finding in a writing support task .
Research method	"The first method uses contextual prefiltering and content-based recommendation ( CBR ) , the second uses the just-intime information retrieval paradigm ( JITIR ) , and the third is a novel network-based recommendation system where context is part of the recommendation model ( CIA ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that each method has its own strengths : CBR is strong at context relevance , JITIR captures document relevance well , and CIA achieves the best result at predicting user action ."
Research findings/conclusions	Weaknesses include that CBR depends on a manual source to determine the context and in JITIR the context query can fail when the textual content is not sufficient .
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that to truly support a knowledge worker , all 4 evaluation criteria are important ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In light of that conclusion , we argue that the network-based approach the CIA offers has the highest robustness and flexibility for context-aware information recommendation ."
Research method	"To assess the difference between the two approaches , 1,040 articles with a variant of the phrase evolutionarily stable strategies ( ESS ) were identified by searching the Web of Science ( Thomson Reuters , Philadelphia , PA ) and discipline-level databases ."
Research findings/conclusions	The majority ( 72 % ) of all articles were published in life sciences journals .
Research method	The ESS concept is associated with a small set of canonical publications by John Maynard Smith ; OBI represents a decoupling of the use of the phrase and a citation to a John Maynard Smith publication .
Research method	"Across all articles at the record level , OBI is measured by the number of articles with the phrase in the database record but which lack a reference to a source article ( implicit citations ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At the citation-in-context level , articles that coupled a non-Maynard Smith citation with the ESS phrase ( indirect citations ) were counted along with those that cited relevant Maynard Smith publications ( explicit citations ) and OBI counted only based on those articles that lacked any citation coupled with the ESS text phrase ."
Research findings/conclusions	The degree of OBI observed depended on the level of analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	"Record-level OBI trended upward , peaking in 2002 ( 62 % ) , with a secondary drop and rebound to 53 % ( 2008 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Citation-in-context OBI percentages were lower with no clear pattern .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Several issues relating to the design of empirical OBI studies are discussed .
Research method	This new measure is parsimonious as it looks for the smallest set of citing authors ( citers ) who have read a certain paper .
Research questions	The Parsimonious Citer-Based Measure aims to address potential distortion in the values of existing citer-based measures .
Research findings/conclusions	"These distortions occur because of various factors , such as the practice of hyperauthorship ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This new measure is empirically compared with existing measures , such as the number of citers and the number of citations in the field of artificial intelligence ( AI ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the new measure is highly correlated with those two measures .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the new measure is more robust against citation manipulations and better differentiates between prominent and nonprominent AI researchers than the above-mentioned measures ."
Research method	"It applied multiple methods , including eye tracking and stimulated recall interviews , to investigate important aspects of faceted search interface use , specifically : ( a ) searcher gaze behavior-what components of the interface searchers look at ; ( b ) how gaze behavior differs when training is and is not provided ; ( c ) how gaze behavior changes as searchers become familiar with the interface ; and ( d ) how gaze behavior differs depending on the stage of the search process ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results confirm previous Research findings/conclusions that facets account for approximately 10-30 % of interface use .
Research findings/conclusions	They show that providing a 60-second video demonstration increased searcher use of facets .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , searcher use of the facets did not evolve during the study session , which suggests that searchers may not , on their own , rapidly apply the faceted interfaces ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions also suggest that searcher use of interface elements varied by the stage of their search during the session , with higher use of facets during decision-making stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions will be of interest to librarians and interface designers who wish to maximize the value of faceted searching for patrons , as well as to researchers who study search behavior ."
Research method	"A case study was designed focusing on 762 financed articles with a project of FIS-2012 of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III , the Spanish national health service 's main management body for health research ."
Research method	Its finance is therefore subject to the Spanish Government OA mandate .
Research method	A search was carried out for full-text OA copies of the 762 articles using the four tools being evaluated and with identification of the repository housing these items .
Research findings/conclusions	"Of the 762 articles concerned , 510 OA copies were found of 353 unique articles ( 46.3 % ) in 68 repositories ."
Research findings/conclusions	OA copies were found of 81.9 % of the articles in PubMed Central and copies of 49.5 % of the articles in an institutional repository ( IR ) .
Research findings/conclusions	BASE and GS identified 93.5 % of the articles and OpenAIRE 86.7 % .
Research findings/conclusions	Recolecta identified just 62.2 % of the articles deposited in a Spanish IR .
Research findings/conclusions	"BASE achieved the greatest success , by locating copies deposited in IR , while GS found those deposited in disciplinary repositories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"None of the tools identified copies of all the articles , so they need to be used in a complementary way when evaluating OA policies ."
Research method	The present work analyzes the degree of collaboration among scientists from different disciplines to identify the most frequent combinations of knowledge in research activity .
Research method	The methodology adopts an innovative bibliometric approach based on the disciplinary affiliation of publication coauthors .
Research method	"The field of observation includes all publications ( 167,179 ) indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded for the years 2004-2008 , authored by all scientists in the hard sciences ( 43,223 ) at Italian universities ( 68 ) ."
Research method	The analysis examines 205 research fields grouped in 9 disciplines .
Research findings/conclusions	"Identifying the fields with the highest potential of interdisciplinary collaboration is useful to inform research polices at the national and regional levels , as well as management strategies at the institutional level ."
Research questions	"Perceptions of and reactions to trolling behaviors varies significantly from one community to another , as trolling behaviors are contextual and vary across platforms and communities ."
Research questions	"Through an examination of seven trolling scenarios , this article intends to answer the following questions : how do trolling behaviors differ across contexts ; how do perceptions of trolling differ from case to case ; and what aspects of context of trolling are perceived to be important by the public ?"
Research method	"Based on focus groups and interview data , we discuss the ways in which community norms and demographics , technological features of platforms , and community boundaries are perceived to impact trolling behaviors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Two major contributions of the study include a codebook to support future analysis of trolling and formal concept analysis surrounding contextual perceptions of trolling .
Research questions	"However , we still do not understand how knowledge-sharing intention ( KSI ) is formed across poster and lurker groups ."
Research questions	"Accordingly , this study seeks to provide a fuller understanding of the formation of behavioral intention in PVCs by decomposing the psychological formation of KSI and focusing on factors deemed likely to influence the KSI of posters and lurkers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study 's online survey of 177 posters and 246 lurkers from 3 PVCs demonstrated that enjoyment in helping others positively influenced posters ' attitudes toward knowledge sharing , whereas reciprocity and technology adoption variables ( perceived ease of use and compatibility ) positively influenced lurkers ' attitudes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Interpersonal trust and peer influence strongly affected the subjective norm of knowledge sharing in both groups , with posters emphasizing interpersonal trust and lurkers emphasizing peer influence ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , knowledge self-efficacy and resource availability enhanced the perceived behavioral control of knowledge sharing in both groups , with knowledge self-efficacy affecting posters the most and resource availability influencing lurkers the most ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of this study have important implications for both research and practice .
Research questions	"Although there exists an ample amount of research into understanding exploration , most of the major information retrieval ( IR ) systems do not provide tailored and adaptive support for such tasks ."
Research questions	One reason is the lack of empirical knowledge on how to distinguish exploratory and lookup search behaviors in IR systems .
Research questions	The goal of this article is to investigate how to separate the 2 types of tasks in an IR system using easily measurable behaviors .
Research questions	"In this article , we first review characteristics of exploratory search behavior ."
Research method	"We then report on a controlled study of 6 search tasks with 3 exploratory-comparison , knowledge acquisition , planning-and 3 lookup tasks-fact-finding , navigational , question answering ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results are encouraging , showing that IR systems can distinguish the 2 search categories in the course of a search session ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The most distinctive indicators that characterize exploratory search behaviors are query length , maximum scroll depth , and task completion time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , 2 tasks are borderline and exhibit mixed characteristics ."
Research method	We assess the applicability of this finding by reporting on several classification experiments .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results have valuable implications for designing tailored and adaptive IR systems .
Research method	"From approximately 15 million queries , we identified 124,422 that were part of 60,759 user sessions ."
Research findings/conclusions	We present a method for categorizing queries based on related terms and show differences in search patterns between religious searches and web searching more generally .
Research method	"We also investigate the search patterns found in queries related to 5 religions : Christianity , Hinduism , Islam , Buddhism , and Judaism ."
Research findings/conclusions	Different search patterns are found to emerge .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Results from this study complement existing studies of religious information searching and provide a level of detailed analysis not reported to date .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show , for example , that sessions involving religion-related queries tend to last longer , that the lengths of religion-related queries are greater , and that the number of unique URLs clicked is higher when compared to all queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the study can serve to provide information on what this large population of users is actually searching for .
Research questions	"Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing , hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce ."
Research questions	"A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions , excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments , implying the need to use more than a single gold standard method when evaluating indexing and retrieval , and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework ."
Research method	"The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches : evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard , evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow , and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance ."
Research questions	"Communities may evolve over time , because of changes in users ' interests , activities , and new users joining the network ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To better understand user interactions in CQA communities , it is necessary to analyze the community structures and track community evolution over time ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Existing work in CQA focuses on question searching or content quality detection , and the important problems of community extraction and evolutionary pattern detection have not been studied ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a probabilistic community model ( PCM ) to extract overlapping community structures and capture their evolution patterns in CQA ."
Research findings/conclusions	The empirical results show that our algorithm appears to improve the community extraction quality .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show empirically , using the iPhone data set , that interesting community evolution patterns can be discovered , with each evolution pattern reflecting the variation of users ' interests over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis suggests that individual users could benefit to gain comprehensive information from tracking the transition of products .
Research findings/conclusions	We also show that the communities provide a decision-making basis for business .
Research questions	The sensitive nature of much of this information creates a serious privacy threat when documents are uncontrollably made available to untrusted third parties .
Research findings/conclusions	"In such cases , appropriate data protection measures should be undertaken by the responsible organization , especially under the umbrella of current legislation on data privacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To do so , human experts are usually requested to redact or sanitize document contents ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To relieve this burdensome task , this paper presents a privacy model for document redaction/sanitization , which offers several advantages over other models available in the literature ."
Research method	"Based on the well-established foundations of data semantics and information theory , our model provides a framework to develop and implement automated and inherently semantic redaction/sanitization tools ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , contrary to ad-hoc redaction methods , our proposal provides a priori privacy guarantees which can be intuitively defined according to current legislations on data privacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	Empirical tests performed within the context of several use cases illustrate the applicability of our model and its ability to mimic the reasoning of human sanitizers .
Research questions	Biomedical journals are a rich source of information for such multimodal content indexing .
Research findings/conclusions	"For multipanel figures in these journals , it is critical to develop automatic figure panel splitting and label recognition algorithms to associate individual panels with text metadata in the figure caption and the body of the article ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Challenges in this task include large variations in figure panel layout , label location , size , contrast to background , and so on ."
Research method	"In this work , we propose a deep convolutional neural network , which splits the panels and recognizes the panel labels in a single step ."
Research method	Visual features are extracted from several layers at various depths of the backbone neural network and organized to form a feature pyramid .
Research method	These features are fed into classification and regression networks to generate candidates of panels and their labels .
Research method	These candidates are merged to create the final panel segmentation result through a beam search algorithm .
Research findings/conclusions	We evaluated the proposed algorithm on the ImageCLEF data set and achieved better performance than the results reported in the literature .
Research method	"In order to thoroughly investigate the proposed algorithm , we also collected and annotated our own data set of 10,642 figures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experiments , trained on 9,642 figures and evaluated on the remaining 1,000 figures , show that combining panel splitting and panel label recognition mutually benefit each other ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The fusion of information is currently done at query-processing time , which has a direct effect on the response time of search systems ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous research also shows that an alternative to improve search efficiency in textual databases is to precompute term impacts at indexing time .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we propose a novel alternative to precompute term impacts , providing a generic framework for combining any distinct set of sources of evidence by using a machine-learning technique ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This method retains the advantages of producing high-quality results , but avoids the costs of combining evidence at query-processing time ."
Research method	"Our method , called Learn to Precompute Evidence Fusion ( LePrEF ) , uses genetic programming to compute a unified precomputed impact value for each term found in each document prior to query processing , at indexing time ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Compared with previous research on precomputing term impacts , our method offers the advantage of providing a generic framework to precompute impact using any set of relevance evidence at any text collection , whereas previous research articles do not ."
Research method	The precomputed impact values are indexed and used later for computing document ranking at query-processing time .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By doing so , our method effectively reduces the query processing to simple additions of such impacts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that this approach , while leading to results comparable to state-of-the-art ranking methods , also can lead to a significant decrease in computational costs during query processing ."
Research questions	"However , collaboration may be difficult to achieve because of 2 major barriers : geographic distance and social divides ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is predicted that the advancement of information communication technologies ( ICTs ) will bring a puzzled conclusion for collaboration in the scientific community : the Global Village trend with significantly increased physical distance among collaborated scientists and the Virtual Balkans trend with significantly increased social stratification among collaborated scientists .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of this study reveal that the scientific community evolves towards the Global Village generally on both the geographic and social dimension , but with variations in term of collaboration patterns ."
Research questions	"The influence of such collaboration patterns on research performance ( that is , productivity and impact ) , however , is asymmetric to each side of collaborators ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When researchers from top-tier and general-tier institutions collaborate , researchers from top-tier institutions face a decrease in research productivity and impact , whereas researchers from general-tier institutions increase in research productivity and impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the development of ICTs plays an important role in shaping the evolving trends and moderating effects of collaboration patterns ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our Research findings/conclusions provide a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration in the geographic , social , and technological aspect ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To interpret the results , one needs a dynamic theory of word meaning ."
Research questions	We suggest that conceptual dynamics as the interaction between kinds of intellectual and emotional content and language is key for such a theory .
Research method	"We demonstrate our method by two-way seriation , which is a popular technique to analyze groups of similar instances and their features as well as the connections between the groups themselves ."
Research findings/conclusions	The two-way seriated data may be visualized as a two-dimensional heat map or as a three-dimensional landscape in which color codes or height correspond to the values in the matrix .
Research method	"In this article , we focus on two-way seriation of sparse data in the Reuters-21568 test collection ."
Research method	"To achieve a meaningful visualization , we introduce a compactly supported convolution kernel similar to filter kernels used in image reconstruction and geostatistics ."
Research method	This filter populates the high-dimensional sparse space with values that interpolate nearby elements and provides insight into the clustering structure .
Research findings/conclusions	"We also extend two-way seriation to deal with online updates of both the row and column spaces and , combined with the convolution kernel , demonstrate a three-dimensional visualization of dynamics ."
Research questions	"In addition to longstanding players , regional powers and peripheral countries have sought for ways of acquiring and/or developing them ."
Research questions	"The authors postulate that to express the capabilities , relative positions , and interrelations of the countries involved in the production of nuclear weaponization knowledge , dynamic network analysis provides valuable insight ."
Research method	"In this article , the authors use a computational framework that combines techniques from dynamic network analysis and text mining to mine and analyze large-scale networks that are extracted from open theoretical and experimental nuclear research publications of the last two decades ."
Research questions	"More specifically , they build interlinked , dynamic networks that model relationships of nuclear researchers based on the open literature and supplement this information with text mining to classify the nuclear weaponization capabilities of each publication-of each author , organization , city , and country ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using such a comprehensive computational framework , they are able to ( a ) elicit the hot topics in nuclear weaponization research , ( b ) assess the nuclear expertise level of each country , ( c ) differentiate between established and emergent players , and ( d ) identify the key entities at various levels such as organization , city , and country ."
Research findings/conclusions	The ranking includes 500 major universities from 41 different countries .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides an extensive discussion of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 .
Research method	"The ranking is compared with other global university rankings , in particular the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( commonly known as the Shanghai Ranking ) and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ."
Research method	The comparison focuses on the methodological choices underlying the different rankings .
Research method	"Also , a detailed description is offered of the data collection methodology of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 and of the indicators used in the ranking ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Various innovations in the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 are presented .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These innovations include ( 1 ) an indicator based on counting a university 's highly cited publications , ( 2 ) indicators based on fractional rather than full counting of collaborative publications , ( 3 ) the possibility of excluding non-English language publications , and ( 4 ) the use of stability intervals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , some comments are made on the interpretation of the ranking and a number of limitations of the ranking are pointed out ."
Research method	It was argued that there is no bibliometrically meaningful difference .
Research findings/conclusions	Using another somewhat larger empirical sample of 26 data sets I show that the difference may be larger and I argue in favor of the g-index .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this position paper , we highlight and expand on these components and show how they are integrated in various research and educational activities related to data science that are being carried out at iSchools ."
Research questions	"We argue that the iSchool way of doing data science is not only highly relevant to the current times , but also crucial in solving problems of tomorrow ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , we accentuate the issues of developing insights and solutions that are not only data-driven , but also incorporate human values , including transparency , privacy , ethics , fairness , and equity ."
Research findings/conclusions	This approach to data science has meaningful implications on how we educate the students and train the next generation of scholars and policymakers .
Research questions	"Here , we provide some of those design decisions , rooted in evidence-based research , along with our perspective on how data science is currently situated and how it should be advanced in iSchools ."
Research method	"We analyzed total Web of Science- ( WoS ) -indexed publication output in years 2011-2013 for 67 institutions in which OA was mandated to estimate the mandates ' effectiveness : How well did the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of the WoS-indexed articles is actually deposited in each institution 's OA repository , and when ?"
Research findings/conclusions	We found a small but significant positive correlation ( 0.18 ) between the MELIBEA strength score and deposit percentage .
Research findings/conclusions	"For three of the eight MELIBEA conditions ( deposit timing , internal use , and opt-outs ) , one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or latency ( [ a ] immediate deposit required ; [ b ] deposit required for performance evaluation ; [ c ] unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out for deposit requirement ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula to reflect the empirical association we had found , the score 's predictive power for mandate effectiveness doubled ( 0.36 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness , but the present Research findings/conclusions already suggest that it would be productive for existing and future mandates to adopt the three identified conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness , and thereby the growth of OA ."
Research method	"Survivors as well as abusers post high-risk health , legal , and financial questions to Q & A sites ; answers come from individuals who self-identify as lawyers , experts , survivors , and abusers ."
Research method	"Using grounded theory this study examines 1,241 individual posts , each within its own context , raising issues of agency and expectations ."
Research method	"Informed by Savolainen 's everyday life information seeking ( ELIS ) and Nahl 's affective load theory ( ALT ) , the resultant Q & A typology suggests implications for IPV service design , policy development , and research priorities ."
Research findings/conclusions	In many cases they have to be accessible long after the life of the business processes or information systems in connection with which they were created .
Research questions	"To improve the management and preservation of documents , organizations are deploying Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) as a standardized format for documents ."
Research questions	The goal of this paper is to increase understanding of XML document management and provide a framework to enable the analysis and description of the management of XML documents throughout their life .
Research method	We followed the design science approach .
Research method	We introduce a document life cycle model consisting of five phases .
Research method	For each of the phases we describe the typical activities related to the management of XML documents .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , we also identify the typical actors , systems , and types of content items associated with the activities of the phases ."
Research method	We demonstrate the use of the model in two case studies : one concerning the State Budget Proposal of the Finnish government and the other concerning a faculty council meeting agenda at a university .
Research findings/conclusions	Scholarly journals have started promoting their research articles to a wide range of audiences via social media platforms .
Research questions	This article aims to investigate the social media presence of scholarly journals across disciplines .
Research method	We extracted journals from Web of Science and searched for the social media presence of these journals on Facebook and Twitter .
Research method	Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals ' social media accounts were also crawled for data analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	"From our results , the social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1 % and 14.2 % across disciplines ; and it has shown a steady increase in the last decade ."
Research findings/conclusions	The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is distinct across disciplines .
Research questions	"Further , we investigated whether social media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor ( JIF ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant effects on the JIF .
Research method	"In addition , a word co-occurrence network analysis was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly journals on social media platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we highlight challenges and issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions ."
Research questions	"Given the pooled documents , a number of studies have proposed different prioritization methods to adjudicate documents for judgment ."
Research findings/conclusions	These methods follow different strategies to reduce the assessment effort .
Research questions	"However , there is no clear guidance on how many relevance judgments are required for creating a reliable test collection ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	In this article we investigate and further develop methods to determine when to stop making relevance judgments .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a highly diversified set of stopping methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the resulting test collections .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Some of the stopping methods introduced here combine innovative estimates of recall with time series models used in Financial Trading .
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results on several representative collections show that some stopping methods can reduce up to 95 % of the assessment effort and still produce a robust test collection .
Research findings/conclusions	"We demonstrate that the reduced set of judgments can be reliably employed to compare search systems using disparate effectiveness metrics such as Average Precision , NDCG , P @ 100 , and Rank Biased Precision ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With all these measures , the correlations found between full pool rankings and reduced pool rankings is very high ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Classification usually takes place at the level of journals , where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , journal-level classification systems have two important limitations : They offer only a limited amount of detail , and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To avoid these limitations , we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications ."
Research method	"In the proposed methodology , publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications .
Research method	We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications .
Research method	"Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system , we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology ."
Research findings/conclusions	Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements .
Research findings/conclusions	The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relationsfor instance , based on bibliographic coupling ."
Research method	"Using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles , this article explores different types of users of Clinical Medicine , Engineering and Technology , Social Science , Physics , and Chemistry articles inside and outside academia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The majority of readers for all disciplines were PhD students , postgraduates , and postdocs but other types of academics were also represented ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , many Clinical Medicine articles were read by medical professionals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts were found for types of users who often authored academic articles , except for associate professors in some sub-disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests that Mendeley readership can reflect usage similar to traditional citation impact if the data are restricted to readers who are also authors without the delay of impact measured by citation counts .
Research findings/conclusions	"At the same time , Mendeley statistics can also reveal the hidden impact of some research articles , such as educational value for nonauthor users inside academia or the impact of research articles on practice for readers outside academia ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While much research in IR has considered the effectiveness of IR systems , there is still a significant gap in the understanding of how users contribute to the effectiveness of these systems ."
Research questions	The paper aims to contribute to this by studying how clinicians search for information .
Research method	Multiple representations of an information needfrom verbose patient case descriptions to ad-hoc querieswere considered in order to understand their effect on retrieval .
Research method	Four clinicians provided queries and performed relevance assessment to form a test collection used in this study .
Research method	"The different query formulation strategies of each clinician , and their effectiveness , were investigated ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that query formulation had more impact on retrieval effectiveness than the particular retrieval systems used .
Research findings/conclusions	"The most effective queries were short , ad-hoc keyword queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Different clinicians were observed to consistently adopt specific query formulation strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The most effective queriers were those who , given their information need , inferred novel keywords most likely to appear in relevant documents ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study reveals aspects of how people search within the clinical domain .
Research findings/conclusions	This can help inform the development of new models and methods that specifically focus on the query formulation process to improve retrieval effectiveness .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study examined the information interactions in an Israeli virtual health community on Facebook dealing with ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease drawing from the weak ties network theory as a theoretical framework .
Research questions	"Weak ties are social ties or acquaintances that can function as an important source for diversified experiential information and emotional support , reducing stigma and providing a sense of belonging ."
Research method	The study consisted of 23 semistructured interviews with registered members of the group .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions of this study parallel the four functions of weak ties by allowing chronically ill patients : access to diverse sources of information including experiential information from others suffering from the same illness ; the possibility to disclose personal information reducing fear from stigma or rejection ; and a sense of belonging .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study proposes a reflective pause on the HIS adoption literature to broaden our understanding of factors contributing to the user adoption of electronic medical record ( EMR ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the factors influencing the user adoption of EMR and classifies these factors into meaningful categories .
Research method	"We searched the selected keywords on several academic databases and found an initial set of 9,684 studies ."
Research method	"We excluded papers on the basis of their title , abstract , and full text ( 89 remaining papers ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The effectiveness of adoption theories has been explored based on the empirical results identified in the EMR research .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , according to the conceptualization of the factors in the literature , a list of 78 factors affecting EMR adoption was identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These factors were classified to eight categories : individual factors , psychological factors , behavioural factors , environmental factors , organizational factors , financial factors , legal factors , and technical factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results have implications for researchers and practitioners , including policymakers , marketers , information technology ( IT ) professionals , health information management ( HIM ) practitioners , health practice managers , and EMR system developers ."
Research questions	This study therefore examines the impacts of key factors from theories of information systems ( IS ) success and sense of community ( SOC ) on users ' continuance intention in the social cataloging context .
Research method	Data collected from an online survey of 323 social cataloging users provide empirical support for the research model .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate that both information quality ( IQ ) and system quality ( SQ ) are significant predictors of satisfaction and SOC , which in turn lead to users ' intentions to continue using these sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , SOC was found to affect continuance intention not only directly , but also indirectly through satisfaction ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Theoretically , this study draws attention to a largely unexplored but essential area of research in the social cataloging literature and provides a fundamental basis to understand the determinants of continued social cataloging usage ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From a managerial perspective , the Research findings/conclusions suggest that social cataloging service providers should constantly focus their efforts on the quality control of their contents and system , and the enhancement of SOC among their users ."
Research method	Legal ideas are encoded as topicswords statistically linked in documentsderived from topic modeling the corpus of constitutions .
Research findings/conclusions	Using these topics we derive a diffusion network for borrowing from ancestral constitutions back to the US Constitution of 1789 and reveal that constitutions are complex cultural recombinants .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find systematic variation in patterns of borrowing from ancestral texts and biological-like behavior in patterns of inheritance , with the distribution of offspring arising through a bounded preferential-attachment process ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This process leads to a small number of highly innovative ( influential ) constitutions some of which have yet to have been identified as so in the current literature .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our Research findings/conclusions thus shed new light on the critical nodes of the constitution-making network .
Research findings/conclusions	"The constitutional network structure reflects periods of intense constitution creation , and systematic patterns of variation in constitutional lifespan and temporal influence ."
Research questions	It further examines if reviews are cited more frequently than are normal articles .
Research findings/conclusions	All research questions are answered affirmatively : The absolute as well as the relative numbers of reviews in these three subfields are indeed increasing .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , reviews in these fields are cited more frequently than are normal articles : about 70 % more often than are normal articles in Infectious Diseases and Oncology and about 50 % more often in Tropical Medicine ."
Research findings/conclusions	The article discusses possible reasons for this increase and concludes that medical journals should strive to achieve an optimal balance between review papers and original articles .
Research questions	"A growing emphasis on open science and reproducibility is changing how authors cite and acknowledge research infrastructures-entities that are used as inputs to or as underlying foundations for scholarly research , including data sets , software packages , computational models , observational platforms , and computing facilities ."
Research questions	"At the same time , stakeholder interest in quantitative understanding of impact is spurring increased collection and analysis of metrics related to use of research infrastructures ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article reviews work spanning several decades on tracing and assessing the outcomes and impacts from these kinds of research infrastructures .
Research method	We discuss how research infrastructures are identified and referenced by scholars in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the Research questionss of evaluating impact .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Synthesizing common features of a wide range of studies , we identify notable challenges that impede the analysis of impact metrics for research infrastructures and outline key open research questions that can guide future research and applications related to such metrics ."
Research method	The work is based on an exhaustive search in databasesparticularly those in library and information scienceand on citation chaining from papers on citation analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results confirm that use of this technique in the humanities is limited , and although there was some growth in the 1970s and 1980s , it has stagnated in the past 2 decades ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most of the work has been done by research staff , but almost one third involves library staff , and 15 % has been done by students ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study also showed that less than one fourth of the works used a citation database such as the Arts & Humanities Citation Index and that 21 % of the works were in publications other than library and information science journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"The United States has the greatest output , and English is by far the most frequently used language , and 13.9 % of the studies are in other languages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Citations are based on the assessment of many which is why they can be considered to have some credibility .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , we show that citations are incomplete assessments and that one can not assume that a high number of citations correlates with a high level of usefulness ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Only when one knows that a rarely cited paper has been widely read is it possible to say-strictly speaking-that it was obviously of little use for further research .
Research method	"Using a comparison with like data , we try to determine that cited reference analysis allows for a more meaningful analysis of bibliometric data than times-cited analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	Entity type models contain sets of patterns aiming to capture the ways geo-located entities are described in natural language .
Research findings/conclusions	"They are automatically derived from texts about geo-located entities of the same type ( e.g. , churches , lakes ) ."
Research method	We integrate entity type models into a multi-document summarizer and use them to address the 2 major tasks in extractive multi-document summarization : sentence scoring and summary composition .
Research method	"We experiment with 3 different representation methods for entity type models : signature words , n-gram language models , and dependency patterns ."
Research method	We evaluate the summarizer with integrated entity type models relative to ( a ) a summarizer using standard text-related features commonly used in text summarization and ( b ) the Wikipedia location descriptions .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that entity type models significantly improve the quality of output summaries over that of summaries generated using standard summarization features and Wikipedia summaries .
Research findings/conclusions	The representation of entity type models using dependency patterns is superior to the representations using signature words and n-gram language models .
Research method	"By emulating the team science approaches of the scientists studied , the UCLA Center for Knowledge Infrastructures accumulated a comprehensive collection of qualitative data about how scientists generate , manage , use , and reuse data across domains ."
Research questions	"Building upon Paul N. Edwards 's model of making global data-collecting signals via consistent methods , technologies , and policies-to make data global-comparing and integrating those data , the research team has managed and exploited these data as a collaborative resource ."
Research questions	"This article reflects on the social , technical , organizational , economic , and policy challenges the team has encountered in creating new knowledge from data old and new ."
Research questions	"We reflect on continuity over generations of students and staff , transitions between grants , transfer of legacy data between software tools , research methods , and the role of professional data managers in the social sciences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In her contribution , Bates warns that understanding information behavior demands recognizing and studying any one important element of the ecology [ in which humans are embedded ] ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hartel , on the other hand , suggests that LIS would not lose much but would have lots to gain by focusing on core LIS themes instead of embodied information , since the latter may be unproductive , as LIS scholars are latecomer [ s ] to a mature research domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"I would argue that LIS as a discipline can not avoid dealing with those pesky mammals aka patrons or users ; like the cognate discipline and community of communities human computer interaction ( HCI ) , LIS needs the interdisciplinarity to succeed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	LIS researchers are uniquely positioned to help bring together LIS 's deep understanding of information and embodiment perspectives that may or may not have been developed in other disciplines .
Research findings/conclusions	"LIS researchers need to be more explicit about what their original contribution is , though , and what may have been appropriated from other disciplines ."
Research questions	"Author verification is a fundamental task where , given a set of texts written by a certain author , we should decide whether another text is also by that author ."
Research questions	In this article we systematically study the usefulness of topic modeling in author verification .
Research method	"We examine several author verification methods that cover the main paradigms , namely , intrinsic ( attempt to solve a one-class classification task ) and extrinsic ( attempt to solve a binary classification task ) methods as well as profile-based ( all documents of known authorship are treated cumulatively ) and instance-based ( each document of known authorship is treated separately ) approaches combined with well-known topic modeling methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI ) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We use benchmark data sets and demonstrate that LDA is better combined with extrinsic methods , while the most effective intrinsic method is based on LSI ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , topic modeling seems to be particularly effective for profile-based approaches and the performance is enhanced when latent topics are extracted by an enriched set of documents ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The comparison to state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the great potential of the approaches presented in this study .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It is also demonstrates that even when genre-agnostic external documents are used , the proposed extrinsic models are very competitive ."
Research method	"In our study , we conducted a lab experiment to examine the effect of prediscussion note-taking on this phenomenon ."
Research method	The experiment used a murder-mystery hidden profile task .
Research method	"In all , 192 undergraduate students were recruited and randomly assigned into 48 four-person groups with gender being the matching variable ( i.e. , each group consisted of four same-gender participants ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"During the decision-making processes , some groups were asked to take notes while reading task materials and had their notes available in the following group discussion , while the other groups were not given this opportunity ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis results suggest that ( a ) the presence of an information piece in group members ' notes positively correlates with its appearance in the subsequent discussion and note-taking positively affects the group 's information repetition rate ; ( b ) group decision quality positively correlates with the group 's information sampling rate and negatively correlates with the group 's information sampling/repetition bias ; and ( c ) gender has no statistically significant moderating effect on the relationship between note-taking and information sharing .
Research findings/conclusions	These results imply that prediscussion note-taking could facilitate information sharing but could not alleviate the biased information pooling in hidden profile tasks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The first is a refined application of PageRank via the differentiation of citation types .
Research method	The second is a form of mathematical manipulation to identify the roles that the selected management journals play .
Research findings/conclusions	"Their Research findings/conclusions reveal that Academy of Management Journal , Academy of Management Review , and Administrative Science Quarterly are the top three management journals , respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	They also discovered that these three journals play the role of a knowledge hub in the domain .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , when compared with Journal Citation Reports ( Thomson Reuters , Philadelphia , PA ) , their results closely match expert opinions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"During the first step , real-world heuristics on coauthors are able to produce highly pure ( although fragmented ) clusters ."
Research method	The most representative of these clusters are then selected to serve as training data for the third supervised author assignment step .
Research method	The third step exploits a state-of-the-art transductive disambiguation method capable of detecting unseen authors not included in any training example and incorporating reliable predictions to the training data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments conducted with standard public collections , using the minimum set of attributes present in a citation , demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all representative unsupervised author grouping disambiguation methods and is very competitive with fully supervised author assignment methods ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Thus , different from other bootstrapping methods that explore privileged , hard to obtain information such as self-citations and personal information , our proposed method produces topnotch performance with no ( manual ) training data or parameterization and in the presence of scarce information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Text postings only become the actions they perform , such as an information request or deliverable , through the recipient 's work of reading ."
Research findings/conclusions	Text postings thus are designed for their recipients and are built in ways that instruct particular readings .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper , I show that patron requests are interactional achievements co-constituted by librarians and patrons through the exchange of text postings that are designed to be seen as requests ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Reference and User Services Association offers guidelines for online interactions between librarians and patrons .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , such guidelines provide only general recommendations by which librarians may overcome difficulties in identifying the specific information needs of patrons ."
Research method	I examine actual chat logs of virtual reference interactions and describe how librarians engage with patrons to co-construct actionable requests to specify and fulfill patron information needs .
Research method	"Conversation analytic methods are used to identify the way texts are produced to instruct recipients in the ways they are to be read and how these texts serve , through reading 's work , as an analysis of the actions prior texts perform ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Like Academia.edu , it provides a new way for scholars to disseminate their work and hence potentially changes the dynamics of informal scholarly communication ."
Research questions	This article assesses whether ResearchGate usage and publication data broadly reflect existing academic hierarchies and whether individual countries are set to benefit or lose out from the site .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that rankings based on ResearchGate statistics correlate moderately well with other rankings of academic institutions , suggesting that ResearchGate use broadly reflects the traditional distribution of academic capital ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , while Brazil , India , and some other countries seem to be disproportionately taking advantage of ResearchGate , academics in China , South Korea , and Russia may be missing opportunities to use ResearchGate to maximize the academic impact of their publications ."
Research method	"Multiple methods were employed for data collection : questionnaires , think-aloud protocols , and transaction logs ."
Research findings/conclusions	The paper identifies seven types of orientation tactics applied by the two groups of users .
Research findings/conclusions	"While sighted users focused on skimming DL content , blind users concentrated on exploring DL structure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the authors discovered 13 types of system , user , and interaction factors that led to the use of orientation tactics ."
Research findings/conclusions	More system factors than user factors affect blind users ' tactics in browsing DL structures .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions of this study support the social model that the sight-centered design of DLs , rather than blind users ' disability , prohibits them from effectively interacting with a DL ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Simultaneously , the results reveal the limitation of existing interactive information retrieval models that do not take people with disabilities into consideration ."
Research findings/conclusions	DL design implications are discussed based on the identified factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"To prevent comprehension and accessibility issues in these cases , data infrastructures can be useful ."
Research questions	The establishment of such data infrastructures requires a clear understanding of the business processes and information flows within the archeological domain .
Research method	"This study attempts to provide insights into how information is managed in Flemish archeological processes and how this management process can be enhanced : an exploratory study based on an analysis of the new Flemish Immovable Heritage Decree , informal interviews with Flemish archeological organizations , and the results of an international survey ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Three main processes , in which certified archeologists and the Flemish Heritage agency are key actors , were identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Multiple types of information , the majority of which contain a geographical component , are recorded , acquired , used , and exchanged ."
Research questions	Geographical information systems ( GIS ) and geodatabases therefore appear to be valuable components of an archeology-specific data infrastructure .
Research questions	This is of interest because GIS are widely adopted in archeology and multiple Flemish archeological organizations are in favor of a government-provided exchange standard or database templates for data recording .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , free and open source software is preferred to ensure cost efficiency and customizability ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper provides an early review of administrative costs incurred by universities in making research outputs OA , either via publication in journals ( Gold OA ) , involving payment of article-processing charges ( APCs ) , or via deposit in repositories ( Green OA ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using data from 29 UK institutions , it finds that the administrative time , as well as the cost incurred by universities , to make an article OA using the Gold route is over 2.5 times higher than Green ."
Research method	Costs are then modeled at a national level using recent UK policy initiatives from Research Councils UK and the Higher Education Funding Councils ' Research Excellence Framework as case studies .
Research findings/conclusions	The study also demonstrates that the costs of complying with research funders ' OA policies are considerably higher than where an OA publication is left entirely to authors ' discretion .
Research findings/conclusions	Key target areas for future efficiencies in the business processes are identified and potential cost savings calculated .
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis is designed to inform ongoing policy development at the institutional and national levels .
Research questions	"However , most existing studies are conducted through relatively small-scale user studies , which may not reflect a real-world and natural search scenario ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose to study the multidimensional user relevance model ( MURM ) on large scale query logs , which record users ' various search behaviors ( e.g. , query reformulations , clicks and dwelling time , etc . )"
Research findings/conclusions	in natural search settings .
Research findings/conclusions	"We advance an existing MURM model ( including five dimensions : topicality , novelty , reliability , understandability , and scope ) by providing two additional dimensions , that is , interest and habit ."
Research findings/conclusions	The two new dimensions represent personalized relevance judgment on retrieved documents .
Research method	"Further , for each dimension in the enriched MURM model , a set of computable features are formulated ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By conducting extensive document ranking experiments on Bing 's query logs and TREC session Track data , we systematically investigated the impact of each dimension on retrieval performance and gained a series of insightful Research findings/conclusions which may bring benefits for the design of future IR systems ."
Research method	The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 ( LR ) was published early in 2012 .
Research method	"Starting from Goldstein and Spiegelhalter 's ( 1996 ) recommendations for conducting quantitative comparisons among institutions , in this study we undertook a reformulation of the LR by means of multilevel regression models ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , with our models we replicated the ranking results ; second , the reanalysis of the LR data showed that only 5 % of the PPtop10 % total variation is attributable to differences between universities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Beyond that , about 80 % of the variation between universities can be explained by differences among countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	If covariates are included in the model the differences among most of the universities become meaningless .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions have implications for conducting university rankings in general and for the LR in particular .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , with Goldstein-adjusted confidence intervals , it is possible to interpret the significance of differences among universities meaningfully : Rank differences among universities should be interpreted as meaningful only if their confidence intervals do not overlap ."
Research method	Three test collections were built .
Research method	The first collection tests the impact of tags on retrieval performance when only the title and abstract are available ( the abstract environment ) .
Research method	The second tests the impact of tags when the full text is available ( the full-text environment ) .
Research method	The third compares the retrieval effectiveness of tags and author keywords in the abstract environment .
Research method	"In addition , both single-word queries and phrase queries are tested to understand the impact of different query types ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that including tags and author keywords in indexes can enhance recall but may improve or worsen average precision depending on retrieval environments and query types .
Research findings/conclusions	"Indexing tags and author keywords for searching using phrase queries in the abstract environment showed improved average precision , whereas indexing tags for searching using single-word queries in the full-text environment led to a significant drop in average precision ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The comparison between tags and author keywords in the abstract environment indicates that they have comparable impact on average precision , but author keywords are more advantageous in enhancing recall ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions from this study provide useful implications for designing retrieval systems that incorporate tags and author keywords .
Research method	"This article presents a mixed-methods study of LibraryThing and Goodreads , which have characteristics of information-centric online communities and social digital libraries , with attention to their roles as boundary objects , users ' information values , and information behavior , and other boundaries and boundary objects at play ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Content analysis of messages , a survey of users , and qualitative interviews show LibraryThing and Goodreads help establish community and organizational structure ; support sharing of information values ; and facilitate the building and maintenance of social ties ."
Research questions	Translation of meanings and understandings within and between communities is a key activity in these roles .
Research findings/conclusions	"Online communities and social digital libraries should highlight translation processes and resources ; provide user profiles and off-topic spaces and encourage their use ; take a sociotechnical approach to tailor technology and community features to the right audiences ; and facilitate the establishment of shared structure , values , and ties and the work of boundary spanners ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further implications exist for research on and theorizing of information-centric online communities , boundaries , and boundary objects as part of the sociotechnical infrastructure surrounding online information sharing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research defines the leadership role based on the corresponding author 's affiliation , and presents the first quantitative research on the factors and evolution of 5 proximity dimensions ( geographical , cognitive , institutional , social , and economic ) of research leadership ."
Research method	"The data to capture research leadership consist of a set of multi-institution articles in the fields of Life Sciences & Biomedicine , Technology , Physical Sciences , Social Sciences , and Humanities & Arts during 2013-2017 from the Web of Science Core Citation Database ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A Tobit regression-based gravity model indicates that the mass of research leadership of both the leading and participating institutions and the geographical , cognitive , institutional , social , and economic proximities are important factors for the flow of research leadership among Chinese institutions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In general , the effect of these proximities for research leadership flow has been declining recently ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The outcome of this research sheds light on the leadership evolution and flow among Chinese institutions , and thus can provide evidence and support for grant allocation policies to facilitate scientific research and collaborations ."
Research method	We introduce the label and the logic behind it .
Research findings/conclusions	A label for peer-reviewed books encourages transparency in academic book publishing .
Research questions	It is especially relevant for the social sciences and humanities and in the context of performance-based funding of university research .
Research method	Automatic query expansion is the process of reformulating the original query with the goal of improving retrieval effectiveness .
Research questions	Many successful query expansion techniques model syntagmatic associations that infer two terms co-occur more often than by chance in natural language .
Research questions	"However , structural linguistics relies on both syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations to deduce the meaning of a word ."
Research questions	"Given the success of dependency-based approaches to query expansion and the reliance on word meanings in the query formulation process , we argue that modeling both syntagmatic and paradigmatic information in the query expansion process improves retrieval effectiveness ."
Research method	"This article develops and evaluates a new query expansion technique that is based on a formal , corpus-based model of word meaning that models syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We demonstrate that when sufficient statistical information exists , as in the case of longer queries , including paradigmatic information alone provides significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across a wide variety of data sets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More generally , when our new query expansion approach is applied to large-scale web retrieval it demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over a strong baseline system , based on a commercial search engine ."
Research method	"To explore the diversity of research collaborations , this article performs a temporal analysis on the scientific careers of researchers in the field of computer science ."
Research method	"Specifically , we analyze collaborators using 2 indicators : the research topic diversity , measured by the Author-Conference-Topic model and cosine , and the impact diversity , measured by the normalized standard deviation of h-indices ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that the collaborators of high-impact researchers tend to study diverse research topics and have diverse h-indices .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , by setting PhD graduation as an important milestone in researchers ' careers , we examine several indicators related to scientific collaboration and their effects on a career ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that collaborating with authoritative authors plays an important role prior to a researcher 's PhD graduation , but working with non-authoritative authors carries more weight after PhD graduation ."
Research method	CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+ were extended to predict user clicks on search engine result pages .
Research method	"Their performance was evaluated using actual behavioral data from an experiment in which 2 types of information search tasks ( simple vs. difficult ) , were presented to younger and older participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that the model predictions matched significantly better with the actual user behavior on difficult tasks compared to simple tasks and with younger participants compared to older participants , especially for difficult tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , the matches were significantly better with CoLiDeS+ compared to CoLiDeS , especially for difficult tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that the advanced capabilities of CoLiDeS+ , such as incorporating contextual information and implementing backtracking strategies enable it to predict user behavior significantly better than CoLiDeS , especially on difficult tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	The usefulness of these modeling outcomes for the design of support systems for older adults is discussed .
Research method	"In this study , we drew from the existing principles and evaluation methods to develop a User Interaction Framework , with concrete criteria in five dimensions : Access , Trust , Understand , Engage-integrate , and Participate ."
Research method	The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that , overall , portals perform well in terms of providing access , but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better , regarding user access , trust , engagement , and participation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , city governments need to develop clear plans about what data should be available and how to make them available to their public ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In turn , a lack of physical cues , challenges in establishing common ground with others and reduced face-to-face interaction each has the potential to hinder communication within an organization ."
Research questions	Large multinational organizations may rely on transactive memory systems as a means of sharing knowledge and helping employees to accomplish day-to-day tasks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Research demonstrates that new information communication technology facilitates the development of transactive memory systems , but the role of transactive memory in virtual work arrangements is less studied ."
Research questions	This article explores how dimensions of virtual work impact transactive memory systems .
Research method	Data were collected from a large multinational organization that provides technology consulting services .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions from this study demonstrate a clear relationship between the formation of transactive memory systems and the degree of geographic dispersion of employees .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the formation of transactive memory systems is negatively impacted by the diversity of teams ' job functions ."
Research findings/conclusions	The use of internal information communication technology plays a positive role in influencing organizational memory when teams are geographically and functionally diverse .
Research findings/conclusions	The results provide insight into how organizations can better utilize transactive memory systems to improve communication in virtual settings .
Research questions	"In this domain , users often misspell or lack knowledge of the proper medical terms to use in queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To overcome these difficulties and attempt to retrieve higher-quality content , we developed a query suggestion system that provides alternative queries combining the Portuguese or English language with lay or medico-scientific terminology ."
Research questions	Here we evaluate this system 's impact on the medical accuracy of the knowledge acquired during the search .
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation shows that simply providing these suggestions contributes to reduce the quantity of incorrect content .
Research findings/conclusions	"This indicates that even when suggestions are not clicked , they are useful either for subsequent queries ' formulation or for interpreting search results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Clicking on suggestions , regardless of type , leads to answers with more correct content ."
Research findings/conclusions	An analysis by type of suggestion and user characteristics showed that the benefits of certain languages and terminologies are more perceptible in users with certain levels of English proficiency and health literacy .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This suggests a personalization of this suggestion system toward these characteristics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the effect of language is more preponderant than the effect of terminology ."
Research findings/conclusions	Clicks on English suggestions are clearly preferable to clicks on Portuguese ones .
Research findings/conclusions	"There are several methods developed , covering distinct aspects of the problem and disparate strategies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , no single technique fits well in all cases or for all data sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations , but require manually labeled training , which is very cumbersome and expensive to acquire , mainly for a new application ."
Research questions	"In this context , we propose to combine several popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment analysis methods by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy ."
Research questions	One of our main goals is to reduce the large variability ( low stability ) of the unsupervised methods across different domains .
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method ( aka , 10SENT ) improves the effectiveness of the classification task , considering thirteen different data sets ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Also , it tackles the key problem of cross-domain low stability and produces the best ( or close to best ) results in almost all considered contexts , without any additional costs ( e.g. , manual labeling ) ."
Research questions	"Finally , we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment analysis to gather additional ( unsupervised ) information for the proposed approach , and we show the potential of this technique to improve our results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Its short text nature means that the service is open to a variety of different usage patterns , which have evolved rapidly in terms of user base and utilization ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Prior work has categorized Twitter users , as well as studied the use of lists and re-tweets and how these can be used to infer user profiles and interests ."
Research questions	"The focus of this article is on studying why and how Twitter users mark tweets as favoritesa functionality with currently poorly understood usage , but strong relevance for personalization and information access applications ."
Research method	"Firstly , manual analysis and classification are carried out on a randomly chosen set of favorited tweets , which reveal different approaches to using this functionality ( i.e. , bookmarks , thanks , like , conversational , and self-promotion ) ."
Research method	"Secondly , an automatic favorites classification approach is proposed , based on the categories established in the previous step ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our machine learning experiments demonstrate a high degree of success in matching human judgments in classifying favorites according to usage type .
Research findings/conclusions	"In conclusion , we discuss the Research questionss to which these data could be put , in the context of identifying users ' patterns of interests ."
Research questions	"In this work , we explore various methods of predicting the ratio of male viewers to female viewers onYouTube ."
Research method	"First , we propose and examine two hypotheses relating to audience consistency and topic consistency ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The former means that videos made by the same authors tend to have similar male-to-female audience ratios , whereas the latter means that videos with similar topics tend to have similar audience gender ratios ."
Research method	"To predict the audience gender ratio before video publication , two features based on these two hypotheses and other features are used in multiple linear regression ( MLR ) and support vector regression ( SVR ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that these two features are the key indicators of audience gender , whereas other features , such as gender of the user and duration of the video , have limited relationships ."
Research method	"Second , another method is explored to predict the audience gender ratio ."
Research method	"Specifically , we use the early comments collected after video publication to predict the ratio via simple linear regression ( SLR ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experiments indicate that this model can achieve better performance by using a few early comments .
Research findings/conclusions	We also observe that the correlation between the number of early comments ( cost ) and the predictive accuracy ( gain ) follows the law of diminishing marginal utility .
Research method	We build the functions of these elements via curve fitting to find the appropriate number of early comments ( approximately 250 ) that can achieve maximum gain at minimum cost .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Public-funded , international , and collaborative research in DH furthers institutional research missions and enriches networked knowledge ."
Research method	"The Digging into Data 3 challenge ( DID3 ) ( 2014-2016 ) , an international and interdisciplinary grant initiative embracing big data , included 14 teams sponsored by 10 funders from four nations ."
Research method	"A qualitative case study that relies on purposive sampling and grounded analysis , this article centers on the information practices of DID3 participants ."
Research method	Semistructured interviews were conducted with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The study explores how Data Management Plan requirements affect work practices in public-funded DH , how scholars grapple with key data management challenges , and how they plan to reuse and share their data ."
Research findings/conclusions	It concludes with three recommendations and three directions for future research .
Research findings/conclusions	Existing manual subject indexing systems generally produce binary outcomes for whether or not to assign an indexing term .
Research findings/conclusions	This does not sufficiently reflect the extent to which the indexing terms are associated with the documents .
Research questions	"On the other hand , the idea of probabilistic or weighted indexing was proposed a long time ago and has seen success in capturing uncertainties in the automatic indexing process ."
Research findings/conclusions	One hurdle to overcome in implementing weighted indexing in manual subject indexing systems is the practical burden that could be added to the already intensive indexing process .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study proposes a method to infer automatically the associations between subject terms and documents through text mining .
Research findings/conclusions	"By uncovering the connections between MeSH descriptors and document text , we are able to derive the weights of MeSH descriptors manually assigned to documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our initial results suggest that the inference method is feasible and promising .
Research findings/conclusions	The study has practical implications for improving subject indexing practice and providing better support for information retrieval .
Research findings/conclusions	These links must support user navigation and provide a deeper semantic interpretation of the content .
Research method	Current wikification methods exploit machine learning techniques to capture characteristics of the concepts and its associations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In previous work , we proposed a preliminary prediction model combining traditional predictors with a latent component which captures the concept graph topology by means of matrix factorization ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this work , we provide a detailed description of our method and a deeper comparison with a state-of-the-art wikification method using a sample of Wikipedia and report a gain up to 13 % in F1 score ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the model performance showing the importance of the latent predictor component and the attributes derived from the associations between the concepts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we include an analysis that allows us to conclude that the model is resilient to ambiguity without including a disambiguation phase ."
Research findings/conclusions	We finally report the positive impact of selecting training samples from specific content quality classes .
Research questions	"Specifically , we look at the 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia as an instructive case of early warning information seeking ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The bushfires , the worst in Australia 's recorded history , were unique in its ferocity and damage caused , but also in the amount of data and research that was generated ."
Research method	"We analyzed the affected residents ' information needs , seeking and use in terms of their cognitive , affective , and situational dimensions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that residents wanted information that would act as a trigger for action , provide timely warning , and indicate clearly fire severity ."
Research findings/conclusions	Nearly two thirds of residents surveyed did not receive an official warning .
Research findings/conclusions	"Almost half first found out that the bushfire was in their area through personal observation of smoke , embers , or flames ."
Research questions	"We suggest that a form of normalcy bias may have been at work during information seeking , causing people to interpret their situations as normal even when disaster warnings have been issued ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the authorities had adopted a Stay or Go policy to help residents use warning information to decide between staying to defend their property or leaving early , the policy 's effectiveness was undermined by information challenges ."
Research questions	The recent rise in multi-lingual content on the Web has increased cross-language text reuse to an unprecedented scale .
Research questions	"Although researchers have proposed methods to detect it , one major drawback is the unavailability of large-scale gold standard evaluation resources built on real cases ."
Research method	"To overcome this problem , we propose a cross-language sentence/passage level text reuse corpus for the English-Urdu language pair ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Cross-Language English-Urdu Corpus ( CLEU ) has source text in English whereas the derived text is in Urdu .
Research method	"It contains in total 3,235 sentence/passage pairs manually tagged into three categories that is near copy , paraphrased copy , and independently written ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Further , as a second contribution , we evaluate the Translation plus Mono-lingual Analysis method using three sets of experiments on the proposed dataset to highlight its usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Evaluation results ( f ( 1 ) =0.732 binary , f ( 1 ) =0.552 ternary classification ) indicate that it is harder to detect cross-language real cases of text reuse , especially when the language pairs have unrelated scripts ."
Research findings/conclusions	The corpus is a useful benchmark resource for the future development and assessment of cross-language text reuse detection systems for the English-Urdu language pair .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous work focused on developing machine-learning classifiers restricted to specific disasters , such as storms or wild-fires ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We investigate for the first time methods to detect such messages where the type of the crisis is not known in advance , that is , the data are highly heterogeneous ."
Research questions	Data heterogeneity causes significant difficulties for learning algorithms to generalize and accurately label incoming data .
Research findings/conclusions	Our main contributions are as follows .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , we evaluate the extent of this problem in the context of disaster management , finding that the performance of traditional learners drops by up to 40 % when trained and tested on heterogeneous data vis-a-vis homogeneous data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Then , in order to overcome data heterogeneity , we propose a new ensemble learning method , and found this to perform on a par with the Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost ensemble learners ."
Research method	"The methods are studied on a benchmark data set comprising 26 disaster events and four classification problems : detection of relevant messages , informative messages , eyewitness reports , and topical classification of messages ."
Research method	"Finally , in a case study , we evaluate the proposed methods on a real-world data set to assess its practical value ."
Research questions	"These notions are very similar to the notions of independence and consistency , yet slightly different ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is shown that percentile rank scores , as recently introduced by Leydesdorff , Bornmann , Mutz , and Opthof ( 2011 ) , are strictly congruous indicators of relative performance , and similarly , that the Integrated Impact Indicator ( I3 ) , introduced by Leydesdorff and Bornmann ( 2011 ) , is a strictly congruous indicator of absolute performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis highlights the challenge of finding adequate axioms for ranking and for research evaluation .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , information from reports is represented in free text , which is difficult to query against for secondary use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Automatic extraction of important information , such as tumor events using natural language processing , offers possibilities in improved clinical decision support , cohort identification , and retrospective evidence-based research for cancer patients ."
Research questions	"The goal of this work was to classify tumor event attributes : negation , temporality , and malignancy , using biomedical ontology and linguistically enriched features ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We report our results on an annotated corpus of 101 hepatocellular carcinoma patient radiology reports , and show that the improved classification improves overall template structuring ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Classification performances for negation identification , past temporality classification , and malignancy classification were at 0.94 , 0.62 , and 0.77 F1 , respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	Incorporating the attributes into full templates led to an improvement of 0.72 F1 for tumor-related events over a baseline of 0.65 F1 .
Research findings/conclusions	"Improvement of negation , malignancy , and temporality classifications led to significant improvements in template extraction for the majority of categories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We present our machine-learning approach to identifying these several tumor event attributes from radiology reports , as well as highlight challenges and areas for improvement ."
Research method	"Using two Nobel Prize-winning contributions , the scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) and the discovery of Buckminsterfullerenes ( BUF ) , we examine the growth of follow-up research via citation networks at the author and subdiscipline level ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A longitudinal network analysis suggests that structure , cohesiveness , and interdisciplinarity vary considerably with the type of breakthrough and over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Scientific progress appears to be multifaceted , including not only theoretical advances but also the discovery of new instrumentation and new matter ."
Research questions	"In addition , we argue that scientific growth does not necessarily lead to the formation of new specialties or new subdisciplines ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Rather , we observe the emergence of a research community formed at the intersection of subdisciplinary boundaries ."
Research method	Bibliometric data for Slovenian researchers registered at the Slovenian Research Agency were used .
Research method	These data were obtained from the Slovenian National Current Research Information System .
Research method	We applied a recently developed hierarchical clustering procedure for symbolic data to the coauthorship structure of scientific disciplines .
Research method	"To track temporal changes , we divided data for the period 1986-2010 into five 5-year time periods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The clusters of disciplines for the Slovene science system revealed 5 clusters of scientific disciplines that , in large measure , correspond with the official national classification of sciences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , there were also some significant differences pointing to the need for a dynamic classification system of sciences to better characterize them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Implications stemming from these results , especially with regard to classifying scientific disciplines , understanding the collaborative structure of science , and research and development policies , are discussed ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extractive summarizers can select such sentencespotentially adding hundreds of unnecessary words to the summaryor exclude them and lose important content .
Research questions	Sentence simplification or compression seems on the surface to be a promising solution .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , compression removes words before the selection algorithm can use them , and simplification generates sentences that may be ambiguous in an extractive summary ."
Research method	"We therefore compare the performance of an extractive summarizer selecting from the sentences of the original document with that of the summarizer selecting from sentences shortened in three ways : simplification , compression , and disaggregation , which splits one sentence into several according to rules designed to keep all meaning ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that on legal cases and biomedical articles , these shortening methods generate ungrammatical output ."
Research method	Human evaluators performed an extrinsic evaluation consisting of comprehension questions about the summaries .
Research findings/conclusions	"Evaluators given compressed , simplified , or disaggregated versions of the summaries answered fewer questions correctly than did those given summaries with unaltered sentences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Error analysis suggests 2 causes : Altered sentences sometimes interact with the sentence selection algorithm , and alterations to sentences sometimes obscure information in the summary ."
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss future work to alleviate these problems .
Research method	The term heritage is used broadly to include scientific and scholarly publications and data .
Research questions	"Although the preservation of heritage is generally seen as inherently good , this activity implies the exercise of difficult moral choices ."
Research method	The ethical complexity of the preservation of digital heritage is illustrated by means of two hypothetical cases .
Research method	The first deals with the harvesting and preservation in a wealthy country of political websites originating in a less affluent country .
Research method	The second deals with a project initiated by a wealthy country to digitize the cultural heritage of a less affluent country .
Research method	The ethical reflection that follows is structured within the framework of social justice and a set of information rights that are identified as corollaries of generally recognized human rights .
Research findings/conclusions	"The main moral agents , that is , the parties that have an interest , and may be entitled to exercise rights , in relation to digital preservation , are identified ."
Research questions	"The responsibilities that those who preserve digital content have toward these parties , and the political-economic considerations that arise , are then analyzed ."
Research questions	"This article examines the questions of why and how the Web of Data , expressed in the Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) , has come to be known as the Semantic Web ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Contrary to previous papers , we deliberately take a descriptive stance and do not start from preconceived ideas about the nature of semantics ."
Research method	"Instead , we mainly base our analysis on early design documents of the ( Semantic ) Web ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The main determining factor is shown to be link typing , coupled with the influence of online metadata ."
Research findings/conclusions	Both factors already were present in early web standards and drafts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions indicate that the Semantic Web is directly linked to older artificial intelligence work , despite occasional claims to the contrary ."
Research questions	"Because of link typing , the Semantic Web can be considered an example of a semantic network ."
Research questions	"Originally network representations of the meaning of natural language utterances , semantic networks have eventually come to refer to any networks with typed ( usually directed ) links ."
Research questions	We discuss possible causes for this shift and suggest that it may be due to confounding paradigmatic and syntagmatic semantic relations .
Research questions	This increase in tag popularity has led to a vast literature on tag recommendation methods .
Research questions	"These methods aim at assisting users in the tagging process , possibly increasing the quality of the generated tags and , consequently , improving the quality of the information retrieval ( IR ) services that rely on tags as data sources ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Regardless of the numerous and diversified previous studies on tag recommendation , to our knowledge , no previous work has summarized and organized them into a single survey article ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a taxonomy for tag recommendation methods , classifying them according to the target of the recommendations , their objectives , exploited data sources , and underlying techniques ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , we provide a critical overview of these methods , pointing out their advantages and disadvantages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we describe the main open challenges related to the field , such as tag ambiguity , cold start , and evaluation issues ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Existing studies are mainly based on Broder 's classification scheme and classify user queries into navigational , informational , and transactional categories according to users ' information needs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we present a novel classification scheme from the perspective of queries ' temporal patterns ."
Research method	Queries ' temporal patterns are inherent time series patterns of the search volumes of queries that reflect the evolution of the popularity of a query over time .
Research findings/conclusions	"By analyzing the temporal patterns of queries , search engines can more deeply understand the users ' search intents and thus improve performance ."
Research method	"Furthermore , we extract three groups of features based on the queries ' search volume time series and use a support vector machine ( SVM ) to automatically detect the temporal patterns of user queries ."
Research method	Extensive experiments on the Million Query Track data sets of the Text REtrieval Conference ( TREC ) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
Research questions	We consider the example of a journal editor ( the principal ) wondering whether his or her reviewer ( the agent ) is recommending rejection of a manuscript because it does not have enough quality to be published or because the reviewer dislikes effort and he/she must work to acquire in-depth knowledge of the content of the manuscript .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The reviewer 's effort provides him or her with superior information about a manuscript 's quality .
Research findings/conclusions	"If this information is not correctly communicated , the reviewer has more information when compared with the journal editor ."
Research questions	"This inherently leads to an encouragement of moral hazard , where the editor will not know whether the reviewer has done his or her job in accordance to the editor 's interest ."
Research findings/conclusions	Prescriptions need to be given as to how the journal editor should control the reviewers to curb self-interest .
Research findings/conclusions	"Besides the associate editors monitoring the peer-review process , incentives can be employed to limit moral hazard on the part of the reviewer ."
Research questions	"Drawing on agency theory , we examine the incentives motivating the reviewers to expend effort to generate information about the quality of submissions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This model predicts that for reviewers early in their careers , promotion-based incentives may mean there is no need for within-job incentives , but also that within-job rewards for a referee 's performance should depend on individual differences in ability and promotion opportunities ."
Research questions	"This study uses the tasktechnology fit ( TTF ) model to explore the interrelationships of e-books , the affordances offered by smart readers , the information needs of academics , and the fit of technology to tasks as well as performance ."
Research questions	We propose that the adoption of e-books will be dependent on how academics perceive the fit of this new medium to the tasks they undertake as well as what added-value functionality is delivered by the information technology that delivers the content .
Research method	"The study used content analysis and an online survey , administered to the faculty in Medicine , Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales , to identify the attributes of a TTF construct of e-books in academic settings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using exploratory factor analysis , preliminary Research findings/conclusions confirmed annotation , navigation , and output as the core dimensions of the TTF construct ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of confirmatory factor analysis using partial least squares path modeling supported the overall TTF model in reflecting significant positive impact of task , technology , and individual characteristics on TTF for e-books in academic settings ; it also confirmed significant positive impact of TTF on individuals ' performance and use , and impact of using e-books on individual performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our research makes two contributions : the development of an e-book TTF construct and the testing of that construct in a model validating the efficacy of the TTF framework in measuring perceived fit of e-books to academic tasks .
Research method	"To explore the use of information as a concept within dominant public health behavior models and the manner in which information practices are handled therein , we undertook a scoping study ."
Research method	We scoped the use of information within core English-language health behavior textbooks and examined dominant models of health behavior for information practices .
Research findings/conclusions	Index terms within these texts indicated a lack of common language around information-related concepts .
Research findings/conclusions	Nine models/theories were discussed in a majority of the texts .
Research method	These were grouped by model type and examined for information-related concepts/constructs .
Research findings/conclusions	"Information was framed as a thing or resource , and information practices were commonly included or implied ."
Research questions	"However , lack of specificity regarding the definition of information , how it differs from knowledge , and how context affects information practices make the exact role of information within health behavior models unclear ."
Research questions	"Although health information interventions may be grounded in behavioral theory , a limited understanding of the ways information works within people 's lives hinders our ability to effectively use information to improve health ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By the same token , information scientists should explore public health 's interventionist approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	A key underlying aspect that emerged when addressing this concept is the aggregation of the relevance assessments related to each of the considered dimensions .
Research findings/conclusions	The most commonly adopted forms of aggregation are based on classical weighted means and linear combination schemes to address this issue .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although some initiatives were recently proposed , none was concerned with considering the inherent dependencies and interactions existing among the relevance criteria , as is the case in many real-life applications ."
Research method	"In this article , we present a new fuzzy-based operator , called iAggregator , for multidimensional relevance aggregation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Its main originality , beyond its ability to model interactions between different relevance criteria , lies in its generalization of many classical aggregation functions ."
Research method	"To validate our proposal , we apply our operator within a tweet search task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments using a standard benchmark , namely , Text REtrieval Conference Microblog , emphasize the relevance of our contribution when compared with traditional aggregation schemes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , it outperforms state-of-the-art aggregation operators such as the Scoring and the And prioritized operators as well as some representative learning-to-rank algorithms ."
Research method	This study measures the degree of compliance with a Spanish government OA mandate 2.5 years after its implementation .
Research findings/conclusions	A total of 58.4 % of articles resulting from publicly funded research had at least one OA copy available 1 year after publication .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among these , 23.8 % were in gold OA , 21.8 % in green OA and 12.8 % in gray OA , i.e. , posted on websites and social networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most of the green OA articles were in 2 disciplinary repositories : arXiv and PubMed Central .
Research findings/conclusions	"Just 14.4 % of the articles resulting from publicly funded research were available in institutional repositories , although more than 90 % of the articles in the data set were the result of projects carried out at institutions that have such an archive ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There is great potential for growth in green OA , because over two thirds of the articles that were not available as OA were published in journals whose publishers allow a preprint or a postprint copy to be deposited ."
Research questions	Science linkage is also regarded as noisy because the subject of patent citation behavior varies from inventors/applicants to examiners .
Research method	"In order to identify and ultimately reduce this noise , we analyzed the different citing motivations of examiners and inventors/applicants ."
Research method	"We built 4 hypotheses based upon our study of patent law , the unique economic nature of a patent , and a patent citation 's market effect ."
Research method	"To test our hypotheses , we conducted an expert survey based on our science linkage calculation in the domain of catalyst from U. S. patent data ( 2006-2009 ) over 3 types of citations : self-citation by inventor/applicant , non-self-citation by inventor/applicant , and citation by examiner ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to our results , evaluated by domain experts , we conclude that the non-self-citation by inventor/applicant is quite noisy and can not indicate science linkage and that self-citation by inventor/applicant , although limited , is more appropriate for understanding science linkage ."
Research method	"Specifically , we gathered data on authors ' genre preferences , rates and modes of scholarly production , and coauthorship patterns ."
Research questions	We also explored the role played by gender and place in determining mentoring and collaboration practices across time .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our biobibliometric profiles of the sextet reveal the different shapes a scholar 's career can take .
Research findings/conclusions	We consider the implications of our Research findings/conclusions for new entrants into the academic marketplace .
Research method	"This article is the result of a 2-year ethnography comprising online archives analysis , participant observation , and 31 interviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the course of the research , the Research findings/conclusions revealed that , not only did participants exchange valuable information and helpful social support , there was often little separation between the two , with each overlaying the other throughout most interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	Expressions of support permeated many informational messages and at the same time served as information to participants .
Research questions	"This article argues that social support and information were inextricably connected within participant interactions and that social support is , itself , a form of information that impacts actions and emotional experiences , contributing to participants being able to make sense of their experiences and to move forward both physically and emotionally ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research builds on work in information science that looks at the ways in which people exchange information in informal environments and extends that research by drawing on conceptualizations of social support to exhibit the connections between social support and information .
Research questions	Its Research questions was to identify whether query modification patterns were related to users ' contextual factors and content sources as well as whether the patterns characterize the use of semantic attributes expressed in users ' search queries in an interactive web-searching process .
Research method	"To this end , a collection of 970 image search queries executed by undergraduate students in a naturalistic setting was analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study 's Research findings/conclusions showed that query modification patterns were significantly associated with content sources .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the types of query modification employed , Reformulation and New were the most frequently used ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Terms related to format , object , or place associated with an image also were found to be frequently used in search queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Terms referring to type or genre were the most frequent attributes in web image search queries , which suggests a change from previous Research findings/conclusions of search queries in a professional context ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications are discussed in terms of search assistants for web image searches and semantic annotation to improve image indexing .
Research questions	Retraction is a self-correction mechanism of the scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , a retracted article may pose a profound and long-lasting threat to the credibility of the literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in retracted articles .
Research findings/conclusions	Such dependencies on retracted articles may become implicit and indirect .
Research questions	"Consequently , it becomes increasingly important to detect implicit and indirect threats ."
Research questions	"In this article , our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of retracted articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of retracted articles with reference to the rest of the literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction ."
Research findings/conclusions	The context of highly cited retracted articles is visualized in terms of a co-citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high-order citation dependencies on retracted articles .
Research method	Survival analyses of time to retraction and postretraction citation are included .
Research method	Sentences that explicitly cite retracted articles are extracted from full-text articles .
Research method	Transitions of topics over time are depicted in topic-flow visualizations .
Research findings/conclusions	We recommend that new visual analytic and science mapping tools should take retracted articles into account and facilitate tasks specifically related to the detection and monitoring of retracted articles .
Research questions	"In interdisciplinary and cross-sector projects , team members may hold distinct views on the types of impact they want to create ."
Research method	"Set in the context of an interdisciplinary , cross-sector project comprised of partners from academia , industry , and the nonprofit sector , our paper unpacks how these diverse project members understand impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis shows that interdisciplinary projects offer a unique opportunity to create impact on a number of different levels .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it demonstrates that a lack of accountable design and collaboration practices can potentially hinder pathways to impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we find that the interdisciplinary perspectives that such projects introduce encourage a rich gamut of sustainable outcomes that go beyond commercialization ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions support researchers working in these complex contexts to appreciate the opportunities and challenges involved in interdisciplinary cross-sector research contexts while imparting them with strategies for overcoming these challenges .
Research questions	The aim of fake news is usually to confuse readers and trigger intense emotions to them in an attempt to be spread through social networks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Even though recent studies have explored the effectiveness of different linguistic patterns for fake news detection , the role of emotional signals has not yet been explored ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we focus on extracting emotional signals from claims and evaluating their effectiveness on credibility assessment ."
Research questions	"First , we explore different methodologies for extracting the emotional signals that can be triggered to the users when they read a claim ."
Research method	"Then , we present emoCred , a model that is based on a long-short term memory model that incorporates emotional signals extracted from the text of the claims to differentiate between credible and non-credible ones ."
Research method	"In addition , we perform an analysis to understand which emotional signals and which terms are the most useful for the different credibility classes ."
Research method	We conduct extensive experiments and a thorough analysis on real-world datasets .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results indicate the importance of incorporating emotional signals in the credibility assessment problem .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , these clinically oriented terminologies and ontologies can not provide sufficient support when integrated into consumer-oriented applications , because these applications must understand both technical and lay vocabulary ."
Research findings/conclusions	The latter is not part of these specialized terminologies and ontologies .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this article , we propose a two-step approach for building consumer health terminologies from text : 1 ) automatic extraction of definitions from consumer-oriented articles and web documents , which reflects language in use , rather than relying solely on dictionaries , and 2 ) learning to map definitions expressed in natural language to terminological knowledge by inducing a syntactic-semantic grammar rather than using hand-written patterns or grammars ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our two-step approach , which show that our framework could be used to induce consumer health terminologies from text ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , there are still no satisfactory solutions ; addressing mistakes are not detected and in some cases correct recipients are wrongly marked as potential mistakes ."
Research questions	In this article we present a new approach for preventing e-mail addressing mistakes in organizations .
Research method	The approach is based on an analysis of e-mail exchanges among members of an organization and the identification of groups based on common topics .
Research method	"When a new e-mail is about to be sent , each recipient is analyzed ."
Research method	A recipient is approved if the e-mail 's content belongs to at least one common topic to both the sender and the recipient .
Research findings/conclusions	This can be applied even if the sender and recipient have never communicated directly before .
Research method	The new approach was evaluated using the Enron e-mail data set and was compared with a well known method for the detection of e-mail addressing mistakes .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the proposed approach is capable of detecting 87 % of nonlegitimate recipients while incorrectly classifying only 0.5 % of the legitimate recipients .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These results outperform previous work , which reports a detection rate of 82 % without reference to the false positive rate ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conduct a quasi-field experiment with 30 bilingual searchers and the results suggested that the ISP model was applicable in studying searchers ' information retrieval behavior in search tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	The ISP model was applicable in studying searchers ' information retrieval behavior in simple tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , searchers ' emotional responses differed from those of the ISP model for a complex task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By testing searchers using different search strategies , the results suggested that search engines with multilanguage search functions provide an advantage for bilingual searchers in the Internet 's multilingual environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions showed that when searchers used a search engine as a tool for problem solving , they might experience different feelings in each ISP stage than in searching for information for a term paper using a library ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results echo other research Research findings/conclusions that indicate that information seeking is a multifaceted phenomenon .
Research questions	"By the beginning of the 21st century , however , departments of ( library and ) information science had turned instead towards the social sciences ."
Research questions	"These programs address a variety of important topics , but they have been less successful in providing a coherent explanation of the nature and scope of the field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Progress can be made towards a coherent , unified view of the roles of archives , libraries , museums , online information services , and related organizations if they are treated as information-providing services ."
Research questions	"However , such an approach seems significantly incomplete on ordinary understandings of the providing of information ."
Research questions	"Instead of asking what information science is or what we might wish it to become , we ask instead what kind of field it can be given our assumptions about it ."
Research method	"We approach the question by examining some keywords : science , information , knowledge , and interdisciplinary ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that if information science is concerned with what people know , then it is a form of cultural engagement , and at most , a science of the artificial ."
Research questions	There is a variety of proposed quality assurance frameworks applied in repositories that are deployed in various contexts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although studies report that there is an improvement of the quality of the metadata in many of the applications , the transfer of a successful approach from one application context to another has not been studied to a satisfactory extent ."
Research method	This article presents the empirical results of the application of a metadata quality assurance process that has been developed and successfully applied in an educational context ( learning repositories ) to 2 different application contexts to compare results with the previous application and assess its generalizability .
Research questions	"More specifically , it reports results from the adaptation and application of this process in a library context ( institutional repositories ) and in a cultural context ( digital cultural repositories ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Initial empirical Research findings/conclusions indicate that content providers seem to be gaining a better understanding of metadata when the proposed process is put in place and that the quality of the produced metadata records increases .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We make two contributions : an empirical and conceptual development of knowledge management as it relates to independent workers and an advancement of social informatics that builds on Gibson 's ecological perspective .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Digital nomads provide an empirical basis to better understand how knowledge management is shifting from organization-centric , with its concomitant emphasis on organizational information systems , to worker-centric , which relies on personal knowledge ecologies ."
Research questions	We advance this concept as a combination of personal knowledge management activities and the digital technologies that support them .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our data make clear that individuals are the locus of personal knowledge ecologies , but these ecologies are embedded in a larger community of collaborators , clients , and peers who are often extensively mediated by digital technologies ."
Research findings/conclusions	This embedding and mediation are at the core of the sociotechnical arrangements that define the personal knowledge ecologies that we document .
Research method	"Based on these properties , P100 was recently introduced as a new citation-rank approach ( Bornmann , Leydesdorff , & Wang , 2013 ) ."
Research method	"In this paper , we conceptualize P100 and propose an improvement which we call P100 ' ."
Research findings/conclusions	Advantages and disadvantages of citation-rank indicators are noted .
Research questions	"Assuming that meaning can not be communicated , we extend Shannon 's theory by defining mutual redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of information ."
Research findings/conclusions	Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications .
Research findings/conclusions	"The information is redundant because it is based on pure sets ( i.e. , without subtraction of mutual information in the overlaps ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that in the three-dimensional case ( e. g. , of a triple helix of university-industry-government relations ) , mutual redundancy is equal to mutual information ( R-xyz = T-xyz ) ; but when the dimensionality is even , the sign is different ."
Research method	We generalize to the measurement in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation .
Research method	"Using Niklas Luhmann 's ( 1984-1995 ) social systems theory and/or Anthony Giddens 's ( 1979 , 1984 ) structuration theory , mutual redundancy can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case : Different meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms ."
Research findings/conclusions	A surplus of ( absent ) options can then be generated that add to the redundancy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Luhmann 's functional ( sub ) systems of expectations or Giddens 's ruleresource sets are positioned mutually , but coupled operationally in events or instantiated in actions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Shannon-type information is generated by the mediation , but the structures are ( re- ) positioned toward one another as sets of ( potentially counterfactual ) expectations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The structural differences among the coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in reflexive and anticipatory communications .
Research method	We provide base maps for Mendeley reader count data using the publication year 2012 from the Web of Science data .
Research method	Example networks are shown and explained .
Research findings/conclusions	The reader can use our base maps to visualize other results with the VOSViewer .
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed overlay maps are able to show the impact of publications in terms of readership data .
Research findings/conclusions	"The advantage of using our base maps is that it is not necessary for the user to produce a network based on all data ( e.g. , from 1 year ) , but can collect the Mendeley data for a single institution ( or journals , topics ) and can match them with our already produced information ."
Research questions	Generation of such large-scale networks is still a demanding task despite the available computer power and digital data availability .
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , it is very useful to have base maps and create the network with the overlay technique ."
Research method	"In-depth telephone interviews with 50 VRS librarians included questions on collaboration , referral practices , and attitudes toward Social Question and Answer ( SQA ) services using the Critical Incident Technique ( Flanagan , ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Community of Practice ( CoP ) ( Wenger , ; Davies , ) framework was found to be a useful conceptualization for understanding VRS professionals ' approaches to their work ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions indicate that participants usually refer questions from outside of their area of expertise to other librarians , but occasionally refer them to nonlibrarian experts ."
Research findings/conclusions	These referrals are made possible because participants believe that other VRS librarians are qualified and willing collaborators .
Research findings/conclusions	"Barriers to collaboration include not knowing appropriate librarians/experts for referral , inability to verify credentials , and perceived unwillingness to collaborate ."
Research findings/conclusions	Facilitators to collaboration include knowledge of appropriate collaborators who are qualified and willingness to refer .
Research findings/conclusions	"Answers from SQA services were perceived as less objective and authoritative , but participants were open to collaborating with nonlibrarian experts with confirmation of professional expertise or extensive knowledge ."
Research findings/conclusions	It provides different modules that help the analyst to carry out all the steps of the science mapping workflow .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , SciMAT presents three key features that are remarkable in respect to other science mapping software tools : ( a ) a powerful preprocessing module to clean the raw bibliographical data , ( b ) the use of bibliometric measures to study the impact of each studied element , and ( c ) a wizard to configure the analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Changes can be indicated at the level of journals using the margin totals of entropy production along the row or column vectors , but also at the level of links among journals by importing the transition matrices into network analysis and visualization programs ( and using community-finding algorithms ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Seventy-four journals were flagged in terms of discontinuous changes in their citations , but 3,114 journals were involved in hot links ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most of these links are embedded in a main component ; 78 clusters ( containing 172 journals ) were flagged as potential hot spots emerging at the network level .
Research findings/conclusions	An additional finding was that PLoS ONE introduced a new communication dynamic into the database .
Research findings/conclusions	The limitations of the methodology were elaborated using an example .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the study indicate where developments in the citation dynamics can be considered as significantly unexpected .
Research findings/conclusions	"This can be used as heuristic information , but what a hot spot in terms of the entropy statistics of aggregated citation relations means substantively can be expected to vary from case to case ."
Research method	"Using a set of chemistry papers and conducting interviews with their authors ( n = 32 ) , I characterize the type of relation the author has with the authors of the references contained in his/her paper ( n = 3,623 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"I show that citation relationships do not always involve underlying personal exchanges and that unknown references are an essential component , revealing segmentations in scientific groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	The relationships implied by references are of various strengths and origins .
Research findings/conclusions	"Several inclusive social circles are then identified : co-authors , close acquaintances , colleagues , invisible colleges , peers , contactables , and strangers ."
Research findings/conclusions	I conclude that publication is a device that contributes to a relatively stable distribution among the various social circles that structure scientific sociability .
Research questions	"The concept of CoPs was originally developed as a social learning theory , and CoPs were defined by their informal emergent nature ."
Research questions	"This informal nature has been recognized to be of value to organizations , resulting in a desire to design CoPs ."
Research questions	"In this article , the nature of CoPs is addressed by focusing on aspects of formality and informality in relationships and learning ; CoPs are described as emergent and designed practices ."
Research questions	"Furthermore , it is questioned whether a designed CoP may realize the essential characteristics attributed to an emergent CoP ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is argued that it is crucial to recognize the informal nature of CoPs in order to either encourage them as informal phenomena or to use the concept of CoPs as inspiration for designing imitations of them .
Research questions	"However , when attempting to design them , the original meaning of a CoP is lost , even though , in some cases , the consequences of such a design may be beneficial to organizations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , when not taking the nature of a CoP into account , a designed construct may have a negative impact on learning and knowing ."
Research questions	"Over the past decade or so , the general needs of people with impairments have increasingly been recognized as something to be addressed , an issue embedded both in international treaties and in state legislation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The same tendency can be found in research , where a growing number of user studies including people with impairments have been conducted ."
Research questions	"The Research questions of these studies is typically to uncover potential barriers for access to information , especially in the context of inaccessible search user interfaces ."
Research method	This literature review provides an overview of research on the information seeking and searching of users with impairments .
Research questions	The aim is to provide an overview to both researchers and practitioners who work with any of the user groups identified .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some diagnoses are relatively well represented in the literature ( for instance , visual impairment ) , but there is very little work in other areas ( for instance , autism ) and in some cases no work at all ( for instance , aphasia ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Gaps are identified in the research , and suggestions are made regarding areas where further research is needed ."
Research method	We then examined the boundary conditions of these models of technology adoption when applied to the household context using longitudinal empirical data from households regarding their purchase and use decisions related to household technologies .
Research method	"We conducted 2 studies and collected 1,247 responses from U.S. households for the first study and 2,064 responses from U.S. households for the second study ."
Research method	Those households that had adopted household technologies were surveyed regarding their use behavior .
Research method	"Potential adopters ( i.e. , those who had currently not adopted ) were surveyed regarding their purchase intentions ."
Research method	This allowed us to identify the most influential factors affecting a household 's decision to adopt and use technologies .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the model of adoption of technology in the household provided the richest explanation and explained best why households purchase and use technologies .
Research questions	"Our focus is on ranking methods and auxiliary processes explored by existing semantic search systems , outlined within broad areas of classification ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We present reflective examples from the literature in some detail , which should appeal to readers interested in a deeper perspective on the various methods and systems implemented in the outlined literature ."
Research method	"The presentation covers graph exploration and propagation methods , adaptations of classic probabilistic retrieval models , and query-independent link analysis via flexible extensions to the PageRank algorithm ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Future research directions are discussed , including development of more cohesive retrieval models to unlock further potentials and uses , data indexing schemes , integration with user interfaces , and building community consensus for more systematic evaluation and gradual development ."
Research method	"The efficacy of this approach is based on the assumption that increasing personal relevance motivates greater elaboration , which is an important precondition for persuasion ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Little research has been conducted to tease out the direct effects of tailoring on message processing .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study examines the effects of a tailored health education site on participants ' evaluations of and elaboration on health messages .
Research method	A total of 151 teens were randomly assigned to explore a tailored Web site or a nontailored Web site on adolescent sexual health and decision making .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results of the experiment indicated a statistically significant main effect for condition ( tailoring ) after controlling for situational motivation and need for cognition , F ( 1 , 148 ) ? = ? 4.467 , MSS ? = ? 2.177 , p ? < ? .05 , partial ? 2 ? = ? .030 ."
Research findings/conclusions	Further evaluations and implications for future research are discussed .
Research method	We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to examine whether the promotion of article links in an online cross-publisher distribution platform ( TrendMD ) affects citations .
Research method	"In all , 3,200 articles published in 64 peer-reviewed journals across eight subject areas were block randomized at the subject level to either the TrendMD group ( n = 1,600 ) or the control group ( n = 1,600 ) of the study ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our primary outcome compares the mean citations of articles randomized to TrendMD versus control after 12 months .
Research findings/conclusions	Articles randomized to TrendMD showed a 50 % increase in mean citations relative to control at 12 months .
Research findings/conclusions	"The difference in mean citations at 12 months for articles randomized to TrendMD versus control was 5.06 , 95 % confidence interval [ 2.87 , 7.25 ] , was statistically significant ( p < .001 ) and found in three of eight subject areas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At 6 months following publication , articles randomized to TrendMD showed a smaller , yet statistically significant ( p = .005 ) , 21 % increase in mean citations , relative to control ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To our knowledge , this is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate how an intervention can be used to increase citations of peer-reviewed articles after they have been published ."
Research method	"We performed a crowdsourced experiment that demonstrates that transcripts of spoken documents created using Automated Speech Recognition ( ASR ) , even with significant errors , are effective sources of document summaries or snippets for supporting users in making relevance judgments against a query ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the results show that summaries generated from ASR transcripts are comparable , in utility and user-judged preference , to spoken summaries generated from error-free manual transcripts of the same collection ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also observed that content-based audio summaries are at least as preferred as synthesized summaries obtained from manually curated metadata , such as title and description ."
Research method	"We describe a methodology for constructing a new test collection , which we have made publicly available ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There have been a handful of arguments given for DIR-coverage , effectiveness , and ease of use , for example-but these are not borne out by experience ."
Research questions	Are there uses for DIR ?
Research questions	"There are , but generally for organizational not technical reasons , and they have not been well studied ."
Research questions	"Existing citation analysis methods assume that all citations in a paper are equally important , and they simply count the number of citations ."
Research questions	Here we argue that the citations in a paper are not equally important and some citations are more important than the others .
Research findings/conclusions	We use a strength value to assess the importance of each citation and propose to use the regression method with a few useful features for automatically estimating the strength value of each citation .
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results on a manually labeled data set in the computer science field show that the estimated values can achieve good correlation with human-labeled values .
Research findings/conclusions	"We further apply the estimated citation strength values for evaluating paper influence and author influence , and the preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness of the citation strength values ."
Research questions	"In this work , we propose a novel descriptive clustering framework , referred to as CEDL ."
Research method	"It relies on the formulation and generation of 2 types of heterogeneous objects , which correspond to documents and candidate phrases , using multilevel similarity information ."
Research method	CEDL is composed of 5 main processing stages .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , it simultaneously maps the documents and candidate phrases into a common co-embedded space that preserves higher-order , neighbor-based proximities between the combined sets of documents and phrases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Then , it discovers an approximate cluster structure of documents in the common space ."
Research method	The third stage extracts promising topic phrases by constructing a discriminant model where documents along with their cluster memberships are used as training instances .
Research method	"Subsequently , the final cluster labels are selected from the topic phrases using a ranking scheme using multiple scores based on the extracted co-embedding information and the discriminant output ."
Research method	The final stage polishes the initial clusters to reduce noise and accommodate the multitopic nature of documents .
Research findings/conclusions	The effectiveness and competitiveness of CEDL is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively with experiments using document databases from different application fields .
Research method	We approach the detection of such articles from three different perspectives in order to provide different typologies of breakthrough articles .
Research method	In all three cases we use the hierarchical classification of scientific publications developed at CWTS based on direct citation relationships .
Research method	We assume that such contextualized articles focus on similar research interests .
Research method	"We utilize the characteristics scores and scales ( CSS ) approach to partition citation distributions and implement a specific filtering algorithm to sort out potential highly-cited followers , articles not considered breakthroughs ."
Research method	"After invoking thresholds and filtering , three methods are explored : A very exclusive one where only the highest cited article in a micro-cluster is considered as a potential breakthrough article ( M1 ) ; as well as two conceptually different methods , one that detects potential breakthrough articles among the 2 % highest cited articles according to CSS ( M2a ) , and finally a more restrictive version where , in addition to the CSS 2 % filter , knowledge diffusion is also considered ( M2b ) ."
Research method	The advance citation-based methods are explored and evaluated using validated publication sets linked to different Danish funding instruments including centers of excellence .
Research questions	"However , the nature of communication channels and how information is produced by and shared with users has fundamentally changed in the last 80 years ."
Research findings/conclusions	One significant change is the growing use of technology-enabled metadata like hashtags when sharing information on social media .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Rarely any study investigates whether hashtags can perform gatekeeping of information and what it means for information gatekeeping .
Research method	This paper fills in the gap by conducting a content analysis of 77 interdisciplinary studies on hashtags and gatekeeping to confirm how they can implement six gatekeeping mechanisms .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study shows that hashtags expand our understanding of the role of technology solutions in gatekeeping and advance research on hierarchical gatekeeping .
Research findings/conclusions	"The benefits of hashtags for gatekeeping suggest that they act as information anchors for online communities , thereby highlighting the utility of information gatekeepers for society ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is even more important for users of online health communities because health benefits usually come with sustained use .
Research questions	"However , little is known about what retains a user ."
Research method	We interviewed 21 participants who had been using online diabetes communities in a sustained manner .
Research questions	"Guided by self-determination theory , which posits that behaviors are sustained when they can satisfy basic human needs for autonomy , competence , and relatedness , we identified mechanisms that help satisfy these needs , and thus sustain users in online health communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Autonomy-supportive mechanisms include being respected and supported as a unique individual , feeling free in making choices , and receiving meaningful rationales about others ' decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Competence-cultivating mechanisms include seeking information , providing information , and exchanging information with others to construct knowledge ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Mechanisms that cultivate relatedness include seeing similarities between oneself and peers , receiving responses from others , providing emotional support , and forming small underground groups for closer interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that , like emotions , information and small group interactions also play a key role in retaining users ."
Research method	System design and community management strategies are discussed based on these mechanisms .
Research findings/conclusions	The transformation seems to originate from a growing interest in bibliometric topics .
Research method	This is evident from a longitudinal study ( 1990-2012 ) of the bibliometric coupling strength between Scientometrics and other LIS-core journals ( including JASIST ) .
Research questions	"The cause of this gradual transformation is discussed , and possible explanations are analyzed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Such studies uncover rich information about these organizations .
Research questions	"In recent years , however , there has been a dearth of co-link analysis , mainly due to the lack of sources from which co-link data can be collected directly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although several commercial services such as Alexa provide inlink data , none provide co-link data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a new approach to web co-link analysis that can alleviate this problem so that researchers can continue to mine the valuable information contained in co-link data .
Research method	The proposed approach has two components : ( a ) generating co-link data from inlink data using a computer program ; ( b ) analyzing co-link data at the site level in addition to the page level that previous co-link analyses have used .
Research findings/conclusions	The site-level analysis has the potential of expanding co-link data sources .
Research method	We tested this proposed approach by analyzing a group of websites focused on vaccination using Moz inlink data .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that the approach is feasible , as we were able to generate co-link data from inlink data and analyze the co-link data with multidimensional scaling ."
Research questions	Their primary goal is to revise or establish beliefs in one or more outcomes .
Research questions	"Search engines are not designed to furnish answers , and instead provide results that may contain answers ."
Research questions	"Information retrieval research has targeted aspects of information access such as query formulation , relevance , and search success ."
Research questions	"However , there are important unanswered questions on how beliefs-and potential biases in those beliefs-affect search behaviors and how beliefs are shaped by searching ."
Research method	"To understand belief dynamics , we focus on yes-no medical questions ( e.g. , Is congestive heart failure a heart attack ?"
Research method	") , with consensus answers from physicians ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that ( a ) presearch beliefs are affected only slightly by searching and changes are likely to skew positive ( yes ) ; ( b ) presearch beliefs affect search behavior ; ( c ) search engines can shift some beliefs by manipulating result rank and availability , but strongly-held beliefs are difficult to move using uncongenial information and can be counterproductive , and ( d ) search engines exhibit near-random answer accuracy ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that search engines should provide correct answers to searchers ' questions and develop methods to persuade searchers to shift strongly held but factually incorrect beliefs .
Research findings/conclusions	"We believe comments left on these videos can provide insight into user interests , but to this point have not been used to map out a specific video community ."
Research method	Our study investigates whether and how user commenting behavior impacts the topology of the K-pop video community through analysis of co-commenting behavior on these videos .
Research method	"We apply a traditional author cocitation analysis to this behavior , in a process we refer to as co-comment analysis , to detect the topology of this community ."
Research method	"This involves : a ) an analysis of user co-comments to elicit the inclination of user homophily within the community ; b ) an analysis of user co-comments , weighted frequency of co-comments , to detect user interests in the community ; and c ) an analysis of user co-comments , weighted sentiment scores , to capture user opinions by polarity ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that users who comment on specific K-pop videos also tend to comment on topically similar YouTube videos .
Research findings/conclusions	We also find that the number of comments made by users correlates with the degree of positivity of their comments .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , users who comment negatively on K-pop videos are not inclined to form specific user groups , but rather present only their opinions individually ."
Research method	"First , we create a data preprocessing model for accurate term cleaning , consolidating , and clustering ."
Research method	"Then we construct a simulated data streaming function and introduce a learning process to train a relationship identification function to adapt to changing environments in real time , where relationships of topic evolution , fusion , death , and novelty are identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main result of the method is a map of scientific evolutionary pathways .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The visual routines provide a way to indicate the interactions among scientific subjects and a version in a series of time slices helps further illustrate such evolutionary pathways in detail .
Research findings/conclusions	The detailed outline offers sufficient statistical information to delve into scientific topics and routines and then helps address meaningful insights with the assistance of expert knowledge .
Research method	"This empirical study focuses on scientific proposals granted by the United States National Science Foundation , and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our method could be widely applied to a range of science , technology , and innovation policy research , and offer insight into the evolutionary pathways of scientific activities ."
Research questions	This study investigates how sustained student engagement in game design and social media use can attenuate the relations between socioeconomic factors and digital inequality among youth .
Research findings/conclusions	"This study of 242 middle and high school students participating in the Globaloria project shows that participation eliminates gender effects , and reduces parent education effects in home computer use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , students from schools with lower parent education show greater increases in frequency of school technology engagement ."
Research findings/conclusions	Globaloria participation also weakens the link between prior school achievement and advanced technology activities .
Research findings/conclusions	Results offer evidence that school-based digital literacy programs can attenuate digital divide effects known to occur cross-sectionally in the general U.S. population .
Research questions	But there is an often-neglected prehistory of OA that can be found in the early DIY publishers of the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Research method	"Managed entirely by working academics , these journals published research in the humanities and social sciences and stand out for their unique set of motivations and practices ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article explores this separate lineage in the history of the OA movement through a critical-theoretical analysis of the motivations and practices of the early scholar-led publishers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Alongside showing the involvement of the humanities and social sciences in the formation of OA , the analysis reveals the importance that these journals placed on experimental practices , critique of commercial publishing , and the desire to reach new audiences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Understood in today 's context , this research is significant for adding complexity to the history of OA , which policymakers , advocates , and publishing scholars should keep in mind as OA goes mainstream ."
Research method	"We investigated Chinese and English speakers ' processing of 4 types of visual stimuli : icons , pictures , Chinese characters , and English words ."
Research questions	"The goal was to examine , via functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data , the hypothesis that people cognitively process icons as logographic words and to provide neurological evidence related to human-computer interaction ( HCI ) , which has been rare in traditional information system studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to the neuroimaging data of 19 participants , we conclude that icons are not cognitively processed as logographical words like Chinese characters , although they both stimulate the semantic system in the brain that is needed for language processing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Instead , more similar to images and pictures , icons are not as efficient as words in conveying meanings , and brains ( people ) make more effort to process icons than words ."
Research questions	"We use this study to demonstrate that it is practicable to test information system constructs such as elements of graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) with neuroscience data and that , with such data , we can better understand individual or group differences related to system usage and user-computer interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	The two key Research findings/conclusions are the following .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , country citation distributions are highly skewed and very similar to each other in all fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , to a large extent , differences in country citation distributions can be accounted for by scale factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Empirical situation described in the article helps to understand why international comparisons of citation impact according to ( a ) mean citations and ( b ) the percentage of articles in each country belonging to the top 10 % of the most cited articles are so similar to each other .
Research questions	"However , a series of early and recent studies demonstrate the existence of indirect and continuous citation impact across generations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Adding to the literature on high-order citations , we introduce the concept of a citation cascade : the constitution of a series of subsequent citing events initiated by a certain publication ."
Research method	"We investigate this citation structure by analyzing more than 450,000 articles and over 6 million citation relations ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that citation impact exists not only within the three generations documented in prior research but also in much further generations .
Research findings/conclusions	"Still , our experimental results indicate that two to four generations are generally adequate to trace a work 's scientific impact ."
Research questions	"We also explore specific structural properties-such as depth , width , structural virality , and size-which account for differences among individual citation cascades ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we find evidence that it is more important for a scientific work to inspire trans-domain ( or indirectly related domain ) works than to receive only intradomain recognition in order to achieve high impact ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our methods and Research findings/conclusions can serve as a new tool for scientific evaluation and the modeling of scientific history .
Research questions	"Meanwhile , interdisciplinary research is increasingly being promoted as a route to advance the complex challenges we face as a society ."
Research method	"In this paper , we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) citation as a proxy context for the diffusion of an innovation ."
Research method	"With an analysis of topic evolution , we divide the diffusion process into five stages : testing and evaluation , implementation , improvement , extending , and fading ."
Research method	"Through a correlation analysis of topic and subject , we show the application of LDA in different subjects ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also reveal the cross-boundary diffusion between different subjects based on the analysis of the interdisciplinary studies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that as LDA is transferred into different areas , the adoption of each subject is relatively adjacent to those with similar research interests ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our Research findings/conclusions further support researchers ' understanding of the impact formation of innovation .
Research findings/conclusions	A comprehensive benchmark is needed to inform best practices in this broad application field .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous benchmarks have evaluated performance for a few supervised classification and feature selection methods and limited ways to optimize them .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The present work updates prior benchmarks by increasing the number of classifiers and feature selection methods order of magnitude , including adding recently developed , state-of-the-art methods ."
Research method	"Specifically , this study used 229 text categorization data sets/tasks , and evaluated 28 classification methods ( both well-established and proprietary/commercial ) and 19 feature selection methods according to 4 classification performance metrics ."
Research findings/conclusions	We report several key Research findings/conclusions that will be helpful in establishing best methodological practices for text categorization .
Research findings/conclusions	"Censorship of identity occurs in different contexts-for example , the military censors the identity of personnel and the judiciary censors the identity of minors and victims ."
Research questions	"We address three objectives : ( a ) assess the relevance of identity censorship in the presence of user-generated comments , ( b ) understand the fashion of censorship circumvention ( what people say and how ) , and ( c ) determine how comment analysis can aid in identifying decensorship and information leakage through comments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"After examining 3,582 comments made on 48 articles containing obfuscated terms , we find that a systematic examination of comments can compromise identity censorship ."
Research method	We identify and categorize information leakage in comments indicative of knowledge of censored information that may result in information decensorship .
Research findings/conclusions	We show that the majority of censored articles contained at least one comment leading to censorship circumvention .
Research questions	"Query suggestions may help , but research suggests these often go unused ."
Research questions	"Although much is known about how searchers scan results pages when assessing relevance , little is known about the processes searchers use when struggling to reformulate queries ."
Research questions	"Investigating how searchers overcome query difficulties , and how search systems help and hinder that process , requires enquiry into the cognitive procedures searchers use to select words for queries ."
Research questions	The Research questions of this paper is to investigate one cognitive process involved : semantic priming of words in memory .
Research method	"A framework for conceptualizing the role of semantic priming in search interaction is presented , along with results from two experiments that applied research methods from cognitive psychology , in an investigation of word selection and subsequent search for selected words ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that word selection activates related words in memory and that looking for a selected word among related words is effortful .
Research findings/conclusions	The finding suggests that semantic priming may play a role in the difficulties people experience when reformulating queries .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Ideas for continued development of semantic priming methods and their use in future research are also presented .
Research method	"We use a Web of Science data set consisting of 3.6 million articles published in 2003 to 2008 and classified into 5,119 clusters ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main Research findings/conclusions are the following .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , the universality claim , according to which all university-citation distributions , appropriately normalized , follow a single functional form , is not supported by the data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , the 500 university citation distributions are all highly skewed and very similar ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Broadly speaking , university citation distributions appear to behave as if they differ by a relatively constant scale factor over a large , intermediate part of their support ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Third , citation-impact differences between universities account for 3.85 % of overall citation inequality ."
Research findings/conclusions	This percentage is greatly reduced when university citation distributions are normalized using their mean normalized citation scores ( MNCSs ) as normalization factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , regarding practical consequences , we only need a single explanatory model for the type of high skewness characterizing all university citation distributions , and the similarity of university citation distributions goes a long way in explaining the similarity of the university rankings obtained with the MNCS and the Top 10 % indicator ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	An agenda for future research on information credibility is also discussed .
Research method	"This study examines the preference for e-books and print books in the contexts of reading Research questions , reading situation , and contextual variables such as age , gender , education level , race/ethnicity , income , community type , and Internet use ."
Research questions	"In addition , this study aims to identify factors that contribute to e-book adoption ."
Research method	"Participants were a nationally representative sample of 2,986 people in the United States from the Reading Habits Survey , conducted by the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project ( http : //pewinternet.org/Shared-Content/Data-Sets/2011/December-2011-Reading -Habits.aspx ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While the results of this study support the notion that e-books have firmly established a place in people 's lives , due to their convenience of access , e-books are not yet positioned to replace print books ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Both print books and e-books have unique attributes and serve irreplaceable functions to meet people 's reading needs , which may vary by individual demographic , contextual , and situational factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At this point , the leading significant predictors of e-book adoption are the number of books read , the individual 's income , the occurrence and frequency of reading for research topics of interest , and the individual 's Internet use , followed by other variables such as race/ethnicity , reading for work/school , age , and education ."
Research method	"Main path analysis , a method used commonly to trace the most critical path in a citation network , helps describe the developmental trajectory of a research field ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study extends the main path analysis method and applies text-mining techniques in the new method , which reflects the trajectory of conceptual development in an academic research field more accurately than citation frequency , which represents only the articles examined ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Articles can be merged based on similarity of concepts , and by merging concepts the history of a research field can be described more precisely ."
Research method	The new method was applied to the h-index and text mining fields .
Research findings/conclusions	"The precision , recall , and F-measures of the h-index were 0.738 , 0.652 , and 0.658 and those of text-mining were 0.501 , 0.653 , and 0.551 , respectively ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Last , this study not only establishes the conceptual trajectory map of a research field , but also recommends keywords that are more precise than those used currently by researchers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These precise keywords could enable researchers to gather related works more quickly than before .
Research method	"On the basis of the supplementary data , we up-scaled the design using Web of Science data for the decade 2003-2013 and OECD funding data for the corresponding decade assuming a 2-year delay ( 2001-2011 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using negative binomial regression analysis , we found very small coefficients , but the effects of international collaboration are positive and statistically significant , whereas the effects of government funding are negative , an order of magnitude smaller , and statistically nonsignificant ( in two of three analyses ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In other words , international collaboration improves the impact of research articles , whereas more government funding tends to have a small adverse effect when comparing OECD countries ."
Research method	"The study used interviews to examine how refugees and asylum seekers dealt with their information needs , finding that information gaps were bridged through people and places ."
Research findings/conclusions	"People included friends , solicitors , and caseworkers , whereas places included service providers , detention centers , and refugee camps ."
Research method	The information needs matrix was used as an analytical tool to examine the operation of sources on refuge-seekers ' integration journeys .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions expand understandings of information sources and information grounds .
Research findings/conclusions	The matrix can be used to enhance host societies ' capacity to make appropriate information available and to provide evidence for the implementation of the information needs matrix .
Research questions	Behavioral financial theory draws on social psychology to explain some of the irrational behaviors associated with financial decisions to help explain some of the fluctuations .
Research questions	In this study we argue that social media users who demonstrate an interest in finance can offer insights into ways in which irrational behaviors may affect a stock market .
Research method	"To test this , we analyzed all the data collected over a 3-month period in 2011 from Tencent Weibo ( one of the largest microblogging websites in China ) ."
Research method	"We designed a social influence ( SI ) -based Tencent finance-related moods model to simulate investors ' irrational behaviors , and designed a Tencent Moods-based Stock Trend Analysis ( TM_STA ) model to detect correlations between Tencent moods and the Hushen-300 index ( one of the most important financial indexes in China ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results show that the proposed method can help explain the data fluctuation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The Research findings/conclusions support the existing behavioral financial theory , and can help to understand short-term rises and falls in a stock market ."
Research method	"We use behavioral financial theory to further explain our Research findings/conclusions , and to propose a trading model to verify the proposed model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"What makes archival collections valuable as evidence is that they are organized in a way that connects the materials to their creator ( s ) , their associated activities , and recordkeeping systems ."
Research questions	In order to create this organization archivists engage in a complex process that involves arranging materials physically and intellectually .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This arrangement focuses on documenting the original order of the materials and making them evident to secondary users .
Research questions	"The time-consuming nature of this process has resulted in a massive backlog of unprocessed ( and thus unavailable ) collections , which represents an impediment to the investigative activities of scholars and researchers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To help alleviate such a situation , this article presents a novel approach to archival arrangement , using tabletop computers and digitized images ."
Research method	The article explains the project design and implementation and discusses the evaluation results .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This work provides several major contributions to the field , including : a new system that allows archival collections to be arranged digitally , new methods and metrics for evaluating archival arrangements , a detailed analysis of the steps involved in archival arrangement and how they correlate with the final outcomes of the process , and a method for analyzing arrangements based on the topologies created by processing archivists ."
Research method	"For this , we conducted an analysis of the availability statuses of over 2.6 million Twitter mentions received by the 1,154 most tweeted scientific publications recorded by up to October 2017 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that of the Twitter mentions for these highly tweeted publications , about 14.3 % had become unavailable by April 2019 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Deletion of tweets by users is the main reason for unavailability , followed by suspension and protection of Twitter user accounts ."
Research method	"This study proposes two measures for describing the Twitter dissemination structures of publications : Degree of Originality ( i.e. , the proportion of original tweets received by an article ) and Degree of Concentration ( i.e. , the degree to which retweets concentrate on a single original tweet ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Twitter metrics of publications with relatively low Degree of Originality and relatively high Degree of Concentration were observed to be at greater risk of becoming unstable due to the potential disappearance of their Twitter mentions .
Research findings/conclusions	"In light of these results , we emphasize the importance of paying attention to the potential risk of unstable Twitter counts , and the significance of identifying the different Twitter dissemination structures when studying the Twitter metrics of scientific publications ."
Research questions	"Due to the interdependent nature of queries in a session , it has been challenging to analyze query reformulation data while controlling for possible dependencies among queries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study proposes a multilevel modeling approach in an attempt to analyze the effects of contextual factors and system features on types of query reformulation , as well as the relationship between types of query reformulation and search performance within a single research model ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results revealed that system features and users ' educational background significantly influence users ' query reformulation behaviors .
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , types of query reformulation had a significant impact on search performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main contribution of this study lies in that it adopted the multilevel modeling method to analyze query reformulation behavior while considering the nested structure of search session data .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Multilevel analysis enables us to design an extensible research model to include both session-level and action-level factors , which provides a more extended understanding of the relationships among factors that influence query reformulation behavior and search performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	The multilevel modeling used in this study has practical implications for future query reformulation studies .
Research method	"The ex-ante peer evaluation ( EXANTE ) of N=8,496 grant applications submitted to the Austrian Science Fund from 1999 to 2009 was statistically analyzed ."
Research method	"For 1,689 funded research projects an ex-post peer evaluation ( EXPOST ) was also available ; for the rest of the grant applications a multilevel missing data imputation approach was used to consider verification bias for the first time in peer-review research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Without imputation , the predictive validity of EXANTE was low ( r=.26 ) but underestimated due to verification bias , and with imputation it was r=.49 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"That is , the decision-making procedure is capable of selecting the best research proposals for funding ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the EXANTE there were several potential biases ( e.g. , gender ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	With respect to the EXPOST there was only one real bias ( discipline-specific and year-specific differential prediction ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The novelty of this contribution is , first , the combining of theoretical concepts of validity and fairness with a missing data imputation approach to correct for verification bias and , second , multilevel modeling to test peer review-based funding decisions for both validity and fairness in terms of potential and real biases ."
Research method	"Through qualitative coding and bibliometric methods , this meta-synthesis provides an in-depth description of acknowledgments research and reveals the five main thematic categories that emerge from this corpus of literature ."
Research method	"Adopting a historical approach , this review shows a diversified and scattered research landscape ."
Research questions	"Despite five decades of analysis putting forward the potential value of acknowledgments as markers of scientific capital , the literature still lacks consensus as to the value and functions of acknowledgments within the reward system of science ."
Research method	"This study adopted a design-based approach to incorporate robotic assistance in investigating the book-locating behaviors of child patrons , and developed a service robot for child patrons in library settings ."
Research method	We describe the iterative cycles and process to develop a robot to assist with locating resources in libraries .
Research method	"Stakeholders , including child patrons and librarians , were consulted about their needs , preferences , and performance in locating library resources with robotic assistance ."
Research method	Their needs were analyzed and incorporated into the design of the library robot to provide comprehensive support .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the study suggest that the library robot was effective as a mobile and humanoid service agent for providing motivation and knowledgeable guidance to help child patrons in the initially complicated sequence of locating resources .
Research questions	Such challenges may be particularly acute when laypeople are considering specialized or technical information pertaining to topics over which knowledge is contested .
Research method	"Within a constructivist grounded theory study of the health information practices of 39 young parents in urban Canada , a complex practice of information triangulation was observed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Triangulation comprised an iterative process of seeking , assessment , and sense-making , and typically resulted in a decision or action ."
Research method	"This paper examines the emergent concept of information triangulation in everyday life , using data from the young parent study ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Triangulation processes in this study could be classified as one of four types , and functioned as an exercise of agency in the face of structures of expertise and exclusion ."
Research questions	"Although triangulation has long been described and discussed as a practice among scientific researchers wishing to validate and enrich their data , it has rarely been identified as an everyday practice in information behavior research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Future investigations should consider the use of information triangulation for other types of information , including by other populations and in other areas of contested knowledge ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Many previous studies have relied on online social network data , providing insights into the ISB of those with Internet access ."
Research questions	"However , in a large-scale natural disaster such as the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 , people in the most severely affected areas tended to have limited Internet access ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , an alternative data source should be explored to investigate disaster-related ISB ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study 's contributions are twofold .
Research method	"First , we provide a detailed description of natural disaster-related ISB of people who experienced a large-scale earthquake and tsunami , based on analysis of written testimonies published by local authorities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This provided insight into the relationship between information needs , channels , and sources of disaster-related ISB ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Also , our approach facilitates the study of ISB of people without Internet access both during and after a disaster ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that the temporal stages of a disaster can characterize people 's ISB during the disaster ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Therefore , we propose further consideration of the temporal aspects of events for improved understanding of disaster-related ISB ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , the reasons that Wikipedia is still struggling to gain acceptance among many academics and higher education professionals are identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These include common misconceptions about Wikipedia , doubts about its quality , uneasiness with the challenge that it poses to the traditional peer-review system , and a lack of career-enhancing motivations related to using Wikipedia ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , the benefits of teaching with Wikipedia for educators , students , and the wider society , as discussed in the current teaching literature , are explored ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , the article presents an argument for using Wikipedia in a variety of ways to help students develop critical and academic writing skills ."
Research method	"The body of scientific literature examined in this investigation was constituted from scientific research that developed alongside the epidemic and was extracted from MEDLINE , a bibliographic database of the United States ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	National Library of Medicine .
Research method	"Content analysis methods were employed for qualitative data reduction , and regression analysis was used to assess whether variation in the trajectory of the epidemic co-occurred with variation in the publication of specific genres of content within the scientific literature relating to HIV/AIDS ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The regression model confirmed a statistically significant association between the representative body of HIV/AIDS scientific literature and the epidemic trajectory , and identified three research categories , namely , ameliorative drug treatments , other clinical protocols , and health education , as being most significantly associated with the epidemic trajectory ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Implicit in the Research findings/conclusions of this study are areas of scientific research that are of functional and practical interest to clinicians , policy makers , the lay public , and contributors to the body of scientific literature ."
Research method	The social website Goodreads seems to be a reasonable source for this Research questions because it includes a large number of book reviews and ratings by many users inside and outside of academia .
Research method	"To check this , Goodreads book metrics were compared with different book-based impact indicators for 15,928 academic books across broad fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Goodreads engagements were numerous enough in the arts ( 85 % of books had at least one ) , humanities ( 80 % ) , and social sciences ( 67 % ) for use as a source of impact evidence ."
Research findings/conclusions	Low and moderate correlations between Goodreads book metrics and scholarly or non-scholarly indicators suggest that reader feedback in Goodreads reflects the many Research questionss of books rather than a single type of impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although Goodreads book metrics can be manipulated , they could be used guardedly by academics , authors , and publishers in evaluations ."
Research method	Quantitative data were collected via an online questionnaire distributed to students on various postgraduate programs at a large UK university .
Research method	"In total , 291 responses were processed for descriptive statistics , Principal Component Analysis , and Poisson regression ."
Research findings/conclusions	Search engines are the most frequently used among the four channels of information discussed in this study .
Research findings/conclusions	"Credibility , ease of use , style , usefulness , and recommendation are the key factors influencing users ' judgments of information characteristics ( explaining over 62 % of the variance ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Poisson regression indicated that individuals ' channel experience , age , student status , health status , and triangulation ( comparing sources ) as well as style , credibility , usefulness , and recommendation are substantive predictors for channel selection of OHI ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Recently , while many researchers have adopted generative probabilistic models for topic detection and tracking , few have compared generative probabilistic models with traditional cocitation and co-word methods in terms of their overall performance ."
Research method	"In this article , we compare the performance of hierarchical Dirichlet process ( HDP ) , a promising generative probabilistic model , with that of the 2 traditional topic detecting and tracking methodscocitation analysis and co-word analysis ."
Research method	We visualize and explore the relationships between topics identified by the 3 methods in hierarchical edge bundling graphs and time flow graphs .
Research findings/conclusions	Our result shows that HDP is more sensitive and reliable than the other 2 methods in both detecting and tracking emerging topics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , we demonstrate the important topics and topic evolution trends in the literature of terrorism research with the HDP method ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The inclusion of creativity in originality , in a minimal degree of creativity , and in a creative spark below the level required for originality , is first established ."
Research method	Conditions for creativity are simultaneously derived .
Research method	Clauses negatively implying creativity are then identified and considered .
Research findings/conclusions	The clauses that imply creativity can be extensively correlated with conceptions of computability .
Research method	The negative of creativity is then understood as an automatic mechanical or computational procedure or a so routine process that results in a highly routine product .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , creativity invariantly involves a not mechanical procedure ."
Research method	"The not mechanical is then populated by meaning , in accord with accepted distinctions , drawing on a range of discourses ."
Research questions	Meaning is understood as a different level of analysis to the syntactic or mechanical and also as involving direct human engagement with meaning .
Research questions	"As direct engagement with meaning , it can be connected to classic concepts of creativity , through the association of dissimilars ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Creativity is finally understood as not mechanical human activity above a certain level of routinicity .
Research findings/conclusions	Creativity is then integrated with a minimal degree of creativity and with originality .
Research findings/conclusions	The level of creativity required for a minimal degree is identified as intellectual .
Research findings/conclusions	The combination of an intellectual level with a sufficient amount of creativity can be read from the exchange values connected with the product of creative activity .
Research findings/conclusions	"Humanly created bibliographic records and indexes are then possible correlates to , or constituents of , a minimal degree of creativity ."
Research method	A four-stage discriminatory process for determining originality is then specified .
Research method	"Finally , the strength and value of the argument are considered ."
Research method	We searched the Web of Science and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database for papers related to EBM .
Research method	"We applied information visualization techniques , citation analysis , cocitation analysis , cocitation cluster analysis , and network analysis to construct historiographies , themes networks , and chronological theme maps regarding EBM in China and the West ."
Research findings/conclusions	"EBM appeared to develop in 4 stages : incubation ( 1972-1992 in the West vs. 1982-1999 in China ) , initiation ( 1992-1993 vs. 1999-2000 ) , rapid development ( 1993-2000 vs. 2000-2004 ) , and stable distribution ( 2000 onwards vs. 2004 onwards ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there was a lag in EBM initiation in China compared with the West , the pace of development appeared similar ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our study shows that important differences exist in research themes , domain structures , and development depth , and in the speed of adoption between China and the West ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In the West , efforts in EBM have shifted from education to practice , and from the quality of evidence to its translation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In China , there was a similar shift from education to practice , and from production of evidence to its translation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , this concept has diffused to other healthcare areas , leading to the development of evidence-based traditional Chinese medicine , evidence-based nursing , and evidence-based policy making ."
Research method	We evaluated different methods for acquiring user profiles based on declared and actual interest in various news topics and items .
Research method	"In an experiment , 36 students rated their interest in six news topics and in specific news items and read on 6 days standard , nonpersonalized editions and personalized ( basic or adaptive ) news editions ."
Research method	"We measured subjective satisfaction with the editions and expressed preferences , along with objective measures , to infer actual interest in items ."
Research findings/conclusions	Users ' declared interest in news topics did not strongly predict their actual interest in specific news items .
Research findings/conclusions	"Satisfaction with all news editions was high , but participants preferred the personalized editions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"User interest was weakly correlated with reading duration , article length , and reading order ."
Research findings/conclusions	Different measures predicted interest in different news topics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Explicit measures predicted interest in relatively clearly defined topics such as sports , but were less appropriate for broader topics such as science and technology ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results indicate that explicit and implicit methods should be combined to generate user profiles .
Research findings/conclusions	"We suggest that a personalized newspaper should contain both general information and personalized items , selected based on specific combinations of measures for each of the different news topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the Research findings/conclusions , we present a general model to decide on the personalization of news content to generate personalized editions for readers ."
Research findings/conclusions	An incomplete metadata record is a record of degraded quality .
Research questions	"Existing approaches to measure metadata completeness limit their scope in counting the existence of values in fields , regardless of the metadata hierarchy as defined in international standards ."
Research findings/conclusions	Such a traditional approach overlooks several issues that need to be taken into account .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper presents a fine-grained metrics system for measuring metadata completeness , based on field completeness ."
Research method	A metadata field is considered to be a container of multiple pieces of information .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this regard , the proposed system is capable of following the hierarchy of metadata as it is set by the metadata schema and admeasuring the effect of multiple values of multivalued fields ."
Research method	"An application of the proposed metrics system , after being configured according to specific user requirements , to measure completeness of a real-world set of metadata is demonstrated ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results prove its ability to assess the sufficiency of metadata to describe a resource and provide targeted measures of completeness throughout the metadata hierarchy .
Research findings/conclusions	"One of the major resources for environmental scanning is online news documents , which are readily accessible on news websites or infomediaries ."
Research questions	"However , the proliferation of the World Wide Web , which increases information sources and improves information circulation , has vastly expanded the amount of information to be scanned ."
Research questions	"Thus , it is essential to develop an effective event episode discovery mechanism to organize news documents pertaining to an event of interest ."
Research method	"In this study , we propose two new metrics , Term Frequency x Inverse Document Frequency ( Tempo ) ( TFxIDF ( Tempo ) ) and TFxEnhanced-IDFTempo , and develop a temporal-based event episode discovery ( TEED ) technique that uses the proposed metrics for feature selection and document representation ."
Research method	"Using a traditional TFxIDF-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique as a performance benchmark , our empirical evaluation reveals that the proposed TEED technique outperforms its benchmark , as measured by cluster recall and cluster precision ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the use of TFxEnhanced-IDFTempo significantly improves the effectiveness of event episode discovery when compared with the use of TFxIDF ( Tempo ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Several previous studies have reported differences in user interaction between conventional desktop computer and mobile device-based web searches , so it is imperative to consider the differences in user behavior for web search engine interface design on mobile devices ."
Research questions	"However , it is still unknown how the diversification of screen sizes on hand-held devices affects how users search ."
Research method	"In this article , we investigate search performance and behavior on three different small screen sizes : early smart phones , recent smart phones , and phablets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found no significant difference with respect to the efficiency of carrying out tasks , however participants exhibited different search behaviors : less eye movement within top links on the larger screen , fast reading with some hesitation before choosing a link on the medium , and frequent use of scrolling on the small screen ."
Research findings/conclusions	This result suggests that the presentation of web search results for each screen needs to take into account differences in search behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	We suggest several ideas for presentation design for each screen size .
Research findings/conclusions	Authors ' emails can be institutional emails and noninstitutional emails .
Research findings/conclusions	"Data suggest that retracted articles are more likely to use noninstitutional emails , but it is difficult to generalize ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study put some focus on authors from China .
Research method	"To this end , nine key studies elaborating Ellis 's model were scrutinized by conceptual analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate that the elaborations are based on two main approaches : adding novel , context-specific components in the model and redefining and restructuring the components ."
Research findings/conclusions	The elaborations have contributed to conceptual growth in three major ways .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , integrating formerly separate parts of knowledge ; second , generalizing and explaining lower abstraction-level knowledge through higher-level constructs ; and third , expanding knowledge by identifying new characteristics of the object of study , that is , information-seeking behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	Further elaboration of Ellis 's model toward a theory would require more focused attempts to test hypotheses in work-related environments in particular .
Research method	"In the current research , existing measures of user-experience factors were identified and , using an online survey , answers to psychometric scales to measure website characteristics , need fulfillment , affective reactions , and constructs of technology acceptance and user experience were collected from regular users of news sites ."
Research method	A comprehensive user-experience model was formulated to explain acceptance and quality judgments of news sites .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main contribution of the current study is the application of influential models of user experience and technology acceptance to the domain of online news .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By integrating both types of variable in a comprehensive model , the relationships between the types of variable are clarified both theoretically and empirically ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Implications of the model for theory , further research , and system design are discussed ."
Research findings/conclusions	We have the inner world ( emotion ) ; we have the outer world ( information ) ; and cognition mediates between the two .
Research method	"We analyze the 3 elements in relation to communication and discuss the semeiotics-inspired communication model , the Dynacom ; then , we discuss our semeiotic perspective on the meaning-creation process and communication with regard to a few , but central , elements in library and information science , namely , the systems-oriented perspective , the user-oriented perspective , and a domain-oriented perspective ."
Research method	"In this paradigm , a distance is computed between each author profile and the query text ."
Research findings/conclusions	These values are then employed only to rank the possible authors .
Research method	"In this article , we analyze their distribution and show that we can model it as a mixture of 2 Beta distributions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on this finding , we demonstrate how we can derive a more accurate probability that the closest author is , in fact , the real author ."
Research method	"To evaluate this approach , we have chosen 4 authorship attribution methods ( Burrows ' Delta , Kullback-Leibler divergence , Labbe 's intertextual distance , and the naive Bayes ) ."
Research method	"As the first test collection , we have downloaded 224 State of theUnion addresses ( from 1790 to 2014 ) delivered by 41 U.S. presidents ."
Research method	The second test collection is formed by the FederalistPapers .
Research findings/conclusions	The evaluations indicate that the accuracy rate of some authorship decisions can be improved .
Research findings/conclusions	"The suggested method can signal that the proposed assignment should be interpreted as possible , without strong certainty ."
Research findings/conclusions	Being able to quantify the certainty associated with an authorship decision can be a useful component when important decisions must be taken .
Research questions	"It discusses the implication of the presence of such bots from the perspective of social media metrics ( altmetrics ) , where mentions of scholarly documents on Twitter have been suggested as a means of measuring impact that is both broader and timelier than citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that automated Twitter accounts create a considerable amount of tweets to scientific articles and that they behave differently than common social bots , which has critical implications for the use of raw tweet counts in research evaluation and assessment ."
Research questions	"We discuss some definitions of Twitter cyborgs and bots in scholarly communication and propose distinguishing between different levels of engagementthat is , differentiating between tweeting only bibliographic information to discussing or commenting on the content of a scientific work ."
Research questions	Collaborations have been studied and encouraged in many disciplines .
Research questions	"However , little is known about how a team really functions from the detailed division of labor within ."
Research questions	"In this research , we investigate the patterns of scientific collaboration and division of labor within individual scholarly articles by analyzing their co-contributorship networks ."
Research method	"Co-contributorship networks are constructed by performing the one-mode projection of the author-task bipartite networks obtained from 138,787 articles published in PLoS journals ."
Research method	"Given an article , we define 3 types of contributors : Specialists , Team-players , and Versatiles ."
Research findings/conclusions	Specialists are those who contribute to all their tasks alone ; team-players are those who contribute to every task with other collaborators ; and versatiles are those who do both .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that team-players are the majority and they tend to contribute to the 5 most common tasks as expected , such as data analysis and performing experiments ."
Research findings/conclusions	The specialists and versatiles are more prevalent than expected by our designed 2 null models .
Research findings/conclusions	Versatiles tend to be senior authors associated with funding and supervision .
Research findings/conclusions	Specialists are associated with 2 contrasting roles : the supervising role as team leaders or marginal and specialized contributors .
Research questions	"At the same time , firms are increasingly dependent on employees ' willingness and ability to make sense of novel tasks , problems , and rapidly changing situations ."
Research questions	"Yet , in spite of its importance , the impact of technology-enabled distributed work arrangements on sensemaking behavior is largely unknown ."
Research questions	"Sensemaking remains something that is perceived by many to be an idiosyncratic behavior that is , at best , loosely related to sociotechnical context and culture ."
Research questions	"Drawing on previous studies of cognitive dispositions ( need for cognition , tendency for decisiveness , intolerance for ambiguity , and close-mindedness ) and research on how technology-enabled distributed work arrangements affect interpersonal interaction , we theorize how workgroup geographic distribution interacts with individual cognitive differences to affect employees ' willingness to engage in the core sociocognitive activities of sensemaking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that the consequences of individual tendencies can vary under different work arrangements , suggesting that managers seeking to facilitate sensemaking activities must make careful choices about the composition of distributed work groups , as well as how collaboration technologies can be used to encourage sensemaking behaviors ."
Research questions	The frontline of defense against such threats is the privacy settings controls provided by OSNs such as Facebook .
Research questions	"However , the efficacy of these settings is often undermined by their poor design ."
Research findings/conclusions	The current design fatigues users with information overload and fails to provide them with a more integrative and global understanding of their information-sharing practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this article , we develop a more efficacious design for the display of OSNs ' privacy settings by following recommendations for appropriate use of visualization techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	The new wheel interface simplifies the presentation of privacy settings to reduce information overload .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It also incorporates an additional layer of information , indicating the safety of users ' settings ."
Research findings/conclusions	A within-subject experiment with 67 students suggests that this interface is more versatile than the current tabular interfaces typically used on OSNs .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"More important , it allows users to easily comprehend complex information and provides them with a more integrative , higher level understanding of their privacy settings ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research focuses on an important niche at the intersection of information representation , interface design , and OSN privacy ."
Research method	Interdisciplinarity is operationalized by the diversity of subject fields assigned to cited items in the article 's reference list .
Research method	"Subject fields and subfields were obtained from the Leuven-Budapest ( ECOOM ) subject-classification scheme , while disciplinary diversity was measured taking variety , balance , and disparity into account ."
Research method	As diversity measure we use a Hill-type true diversity in the sense of Jost and Leinster-Cobbold .
Research method	The analysis is conducted in 3 steps .
Research method	"In the first part , the properties of this measure are discussed , and , on the basis of these properties it is shown that the measure has the potential to serve as an indicator of interdisciplinarity ."
Research method	In the second part the applicability of this indicator is shown using selected journals from several research fields ranging from mathematics to social sciences .
Research method	"Finally , the often-heard argument , namely , that interdisciplinary research exhibits larger visibility and impact , is studied on the basis of these selected journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , as only 7 journals , representing a total of 15,757 articles , are studied , albeit chosen to cover a large range of interdisciplinarity , further research is still needed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article demonstrates the use of data analysis and visualization as a means to empower students , teachers , researchers , and platform developers by making large volumes of data easy to understand ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we introduce the insight needs of different stakeholder groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we compare the wide variety of data provided by major MOOC platforms ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Third , we present a novel framework that distinguishes visualizations by the type of questions they answer ."
Research method	We then review the state of the art MOOC visual analytics using a tabulation of stakeholder needs versus visual analytics workflow types .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we present new data analysis and visualization workflows for statistical , geospatial , and topical insights ."
Research method	The workflows have been optimized and validated in the Information Visualization MOOC ( IVMOOC ) annually taught at Indiana University since 2013 .
Research findings/conclusions	"All workflows , sample data , and visualizations are provided at http : //cns.iu.edu/2016-MOOCVis.html ."
Research questions	"Over the past several years , it has also become evident that user-centered evaluation based on realistic tasks is essential for creating systems that are commercially marketable ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although user-oriented research has been increasing , the MIR field is still lacking in holistic , user-centered approaches to evaluating music services beyond measuring the performance of search or classification algorithms ."
Research method	"In light of this need , we conducted a user study exploring how users evaluate their overall experience with existing popular commercial music services , asking about their interactions with the system as well as situational and personal characteristics ."
Research method	"In this paper , we present a qualitative heuristic evaluation of commercial music services based on Jakob Nielsen 's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design , and also discuss 8 additional criteria that may be used for the holistic evaluation of user experience in MIR systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we recommend areas of future user research raised by trends and patterns that surfaced from this user study ."
Research questions	XML retrieval deals with retrieving those document componentsthe XML elementsthat specifically answer a query .
Research questions	"In this article , theoretical evaluation is concerned with the formal representation of qualitative properties of retrieval models ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It complements experimental methods by showing the properties of the underlying reasoning assumptions that decide when a document is about a query .
Research method	We define a theoretical methodology based on the idea of aboutness and apply it to current XML retrieval models .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This allows comparing and analyzing the reasoning behavior of XML retrieval models experimented within the INEX evaluation campaigns .
Research method	For each model we derive functional and qualitative properties that qualify its formal behavior .
Research method	We then use these properties to explain experimental results obtained with some of the XML retrieval models .
Research method	The rationale is that raters assign higher scores to journals that cater to their area of expertise because they are more familiar with them .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate the existence of raters ' bias toward the journals focusing on their preferred areas of interest , but this bias does not uniformly apply across all research topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In some subdomains , such as intellectual capital , this bias may be very strong , whereas in others , such as soft-side knowledge management research , it may be nonexistent ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although management eHealth researchers rate management-focused journals higher than their clinical-centered counterparts , this bias does not exist among scholars favoring clinical topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While this limitation is not fatal , the results from expert-survey journal ranking studies should be interpreted with caution ."
Research method	We study the impact of this choice on the ranking of 500 universities in the 2013 edition of the Leiden Ranking in two cases .
Research method	"First , we compare a Web of Science ( WoS ) journal-level classification system , consisting of 236 subject categories , and a publication-level algorithmically constructed system , denoted G8 , consisting of 5,119 clusters ."
Research findings/conclusions	The result is that the consequences of the move from the WoS to the G8 system using the Top 1 % citation impact indicator are much greater than the consequences of this move using the Top 10 % indicator .
Research method	"Second , we compare the G8 classification system and a publication-level alternative of the same family , the G6 system , consisting of 1,363 clusters ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The result is that , although less important than in the previous case , the consequences of the move from the G6 to the G8 system under the Top 1 % indicator are still of a large order of magnitude ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , information flow on Twitter is of great volume ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For a specific event , messages collected from the Twitter Stream based on either location constraint or predefined keywords would contain a lot of noise ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a method to achieve both high-precision and high-recall in collecting event-related tweets ."
Research method	"Our method involves an automatic keyword generation component , and an event-related tweet identification component ."
Research method	"For keyword generation , we consider three properties of candidate keywords , namely relevance , coverage , and evolvement ."
Research method	The keyword updating mechanism enables our method to track the main topics of tweets along event development .
Research findings/conclusions	"To minimize annotation effort in identifying event-related tweets , we adopt active learning and incorporate multiple-instance learning which assigns labels to bags instead of instances ( that is , individual tweets ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Through experiments on two real-world events , we demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art alternatives ."
Research questions	"Research on collective trolling , which involves an organized group trolling effort , is in its infancy perhaps because early works on online trolling depicted it as the deviant behavior of individuals who acted in isolation and under hidden identity ."
Research questions	"Thus , it is still unclear what collective trolling is and how it evolves ."
Research method	"To address this gap , we collected 12,840 posts and comments pertinent to a brief , controversial , and very visible collective trolling event ."
Research questions	"The event , which surrounded Chinese rapper PG One on the Chinese microblogging platformSina Weibo , received 40 million reads in 1 day and a lot of media attention ."
Research method	"Based on a thematic content analysis of 480 posts , we describe the collective trolling lifecycle through five distinct stages defined by posting frequency and content of posts ."
Research questions	"We also explain the transformation of participants ' roles , tactics , motives , behavioral tone , and the variations in their thematic content , stakeholder group affiliation , and roles over time ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The major contributions of the study are the characterization of collective trolling , and the addition of a lifecycle model to the understanding of trolling as sociotechnical , context-dependent , and multidimensional phenomenon ."
Research questions	"In this contribution , we examine if this rule also applies to American scientists publishing in highly visible interdisciplinary journals ."
Research method	"Concretely , we compare the citations received by American scientists in Nature , Science , and the Proceedings of theNationalAcademy ofSciences of theUnitedStates ofAmerica ( PNAS ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is shown that , statistically , American scientists publishing in Nature and Science do not benefit from international collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This statement also holds for communicated submissions , but not for direct and for contributed submissions , to PNAS ."
Research questions	"This article examines some of these , namely , whether the sex , age , and identifiability of blog authors , as well as the genre of communication , affect communication strategies ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions suggest that the level of identifiability of the blog author has a limited effect upon their communication strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , sex appeared to influence online behavior in so far as men were more likely to swear and attack others in their blogs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Genre had an important influence on disclosure with more self-disclosure taking place in the diary genre ( i.e. , blogs in which people talk about their own lives ) comparative to the filter genre ( i.e. , blogs in which people talk about events external to their lives ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Age affected both self-disclosure and language use .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , younger bloggers tended to use more swearing , express more negative emotions and disclose more personal information about others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions suggest that age , sex , genre , and identifiability form a cluster of variables that influence the language style and self-disclosure patterns of bloggers ; however , the level of identifiability of the blogger may be less important in this respect ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications of these Research findings/conclusions are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	We surveyed 100 computer science students and found that 94 % ( of respondents ) searched for places online ; 87 % had done so as part of a group .
Research findings/conclusions	"Search for place by multiple active participants was experienced by 78 % , with group sizes typically being 2 or 3 ."
Research findings/conclusions	Search occurred in a range of settings with both desktop PCs and mobile devices .
Research findings/conclusions	"Difficulties were reported with coordinating tasks , sharing results , and making decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that finding a place of interest is a quite different group-based search than other multiparty information-seeking activities .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that local search systems , their interfaces and the devices that access them can be made more usable for collaborative search if they include support for coordination , sharing of results , and decision making ."
Research questions	"Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks , such as extracting opinions from product reviews , there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web , and Twitter in particular ."
Research questions	Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead .
Research questions	"Hence , such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena ."
Research method	This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results from six diverse social web data sets ( MySpace , Twitter , YouTube , Digg , Runners World , BBC Forums ) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment , however , and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results suggest that , even unsupervised , SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts ."
Research method	"Respondents to our survey are mostly active in the information sciences , including librarians ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Besides WTW , other attributes included in the study are the quality of the editorial board , the quality of referee reports , the probability of being accepted , the ISI impact factor , and the standing of the journal among peers ."
Research method	"Interaction effects originating from scientists ' personal characteristics ( age , region of origin , motivations to publish ) with the WTW are highlighted ."
Research findings/conclusions	A difference was made between submitting a high quality article and a standard article .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the interesting results obtained from our analysis we mention that for a high-quality article , researchers are willing to wait some 18 months longer for a journal with an ISI impact factor above 2 than for a journal without an impact factor , keeping all other factors constant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For a standard article , the WTW decreases to some 8 months ."
Research findings/conclusions	Gender had no effect on our conclusions .
Research method	"To effectively study major life transitions and events , we surveyed a large U.S. sample ( n = 554 ) to create the Major Life Events Taxonomy , a list of 121 life events in 12 categories ."
Research method	"We then applied this taxonomy to a second large U.S. survey sample ( n = 775 ) to understand on average how much social readjustment each event required , how likely each event was to be shared on social media with different types of audiences , and how much online network separation each involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that social readjustment is positively correlated with sharing on social media , with both broad audiences and close ties as well as in online spaces separate from one 's network of known ties ."
Research questions	"Some life transitions involve high levels of sharing with both separate audiences and broad audiences on social media , providing evidence for what previous research has called social media as social transition machinery ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Researchers can use the Major Life Events Taxonomy to examine how people 's life transition experiences relate to their behaviors , technology use , and health and well-being outcomes ."
Research method	"Function analysis was based on manual coding of a small dataset in the field of library and information studies , whereas the analyses by frequency and location used both this small dataset and a large dataset from PubMed Central ."
Research findings/conclusions	Strong evidence was found that self-citations appear more likely to serve as substantial citations in a text than do external citations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This finding challenges previous studies that assumed that self-citations should be discounted or even removed and suggests that self-citations should be given more weight in citation analysis , if anything ."
Research method	The ILT contains 40 multiple-choice questions ( available in Appendix ) with four possible answers and follows the recommendations of information literacy ( IL ) standards for higher education .
Research findings/conclusions	"It assesses different levels of thinking skills and is intended to be freely available to educators , librarians , and higher education managers , as well as being applicable internationally for study programs in all scientific disciplines ."
Research method	Testing of the ILT was performed on a group of 536 university students .
Research findings/conclusions	The overall test analysis confirmed the ILT reliability and discrimination power as appropriate ( Cronbach 's alpha 0.74 ; Ferguson 's delta 0.97 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"The students ' average overall achievement was 66 % , and IL increased with the year of study ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The students were less successful in advanced database search strategies , which require a combination of knowledge , comprehension , and logic , and in topics related to intellectual property and ethics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A group of 163 students who took a second ILT assessment after participating in an IL-specific study course achieved an average posttest score of 78.6 % , implying an average IL increase of 13.1 % , with most significant improvements in advanced search strategies ( 23.7 % ) , and in intellectual property and ethics ( 12.8 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If so , sources central to international news may also be central to international recall patterns ; in particular , they may reflect an American-centric focus , given the previously proposed central U.S. position in the news marketplace ."
Research method	"We asked people of four different nationalities ( China , Israel , Switzerland , and the United States ) to list all the countries they could name ."
Research method	We also constructed a network representation of the world for each nation based on the co-occurrence pattern of countries in the news .
Research method	"To compare news and memories , we developed a computational model that predicts the recall order of countries based on the news networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Consistent with previous reports , the U.S. news was central to the news networks overall ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , although national recall patterns reflected their corresponding national news sources , the Chinese news was substantially better than other national news sources at predicting both individual and aggregate memories across nations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results suggest that news and memories are related but may also reflect biases in the way information is transferred to long-term memory , potentially biased against the transient coverage of more free presses ."
Research questions	We discuss possible explanations for this Chinese news effect in relation to prominent cognitive and communications theories .
Research questions	"Hence , specific techniques may tend to generate high-impact Research findings/conclusions within science ."
Research method	This article estimates the citation advantage of a technique by calculating the average citation rank of articles using it in the issue of the journal in which they were published .
Research findings/conclusions	"Applied to structural equation modeling ( SEM ) and four related techniques in 3 broad fields , the results show citation advantages that vary by technique and broad field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , SEM seems to be more influential in all broad fields than the 4 simpler methods , with one exception , and hence seems to be particularly worth adding to statistical curricula ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , Pearson correlation apparently has the highest average impact in medicine but the least in psychology ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In conclusion , the results suggest that the importance of a statistical technique may vary by discipline and that even simple techniques can help to generate high-impact research in some contexts ."
Research method	This was undertaken in the context of a qualitative study into decision making in the initial stages of emergency response to major incidents .
Research method	The research took an interpretive approach in which activity theory is used as an analytical framework .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The research provides further evidence that the context of the activity and individual differences influence the choice of decision mode and associated information behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	We also established that information is often not used to resolve uncertainty in decision making and indeed information is often sought and used after the decision is made to justify the decision .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we point to the significance of both expertise and confidence in understanding information behavior ."
Research method	The contribution of the research to existing theoretical frameworks is discussed and a modified version of Wilson 's problem-solving model is proposed .
Research questions	"However , such freedom also carries concerns about content quality ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this work , we propose an automatic framework to assess the quality of collaboratively generated content ."
Research method	"Quality is addressed as a multidimensional concept , modeled as a combination of independent assessments , each regarding different quality dimensions ."
Research method	"Accordingly , we adopt a machine-learning ( ML ) based multiview approach to assess content quality ."
Research method	We perform a thorough analysis of our framework on two different domains : Questions and Answer Forums and Collaborative Encyclopedias .
Research findings/conclusions	This allowed us to better understand when and how the proposed multiview approach is able to provide accurate quality assessments .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our main contributions are : ( a ) a general ML multiview framework that takes advantage of different views of quality indicators ; ( b ) the improvement ( up to 30 % ) in quality assessment over the best state-of-the-art baseline methods ; ( c ) a thorough feature and view analysis regarding impact , informativeness , and correlation , based on two distinct domains ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the impact of journal articles extends beyond formal scholarly discourse ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Measuring online scholarly impact calls for new indices , complementary to the older ones ."
Research method	"This article examines a possible alternative metric source , blog posts aggregated at ResearchBlogging.org , which discuss peer-reviewed articles and provide full bibliographic references ."
Research method	Articles reviewed in these blogs therefore receive blog citations .
Research method	We hypothesized that articles receiving blog citations close to their publication time receive more journal citations later than the articles in the same journal published in the same year that did not receive such blog citations .
Research findings/conclusions	Statistically significant evidence for articles published in 2009 and 2010 support this hypothesis for seven of 12 journals ( 58 % ) in 2009 and 13 of 19 journals ( 68 % ) in 2010 .
Research findings/conclusions	"We suggest , based on these results , that blog citations can be used as an alternative metric source ."
Research questions	"In this study , we investigate how makers obtain information for their makerspace projects ."
Research method	"The study focuses on four sources of information : people , documents , experimentation , and prior knowledge ."
Research method	"On the basis of interviews with 13 makers , we analyze their use of these information sources in relation to different knowledge areas , creative-process stages , and relevance criteria ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our main Research findings/conclusions are that ( a ) experimentation is a prime source of information , ( b ) ease and pleasure are the dominant relevance criteria , ( c ) process and situation receive little attention , and ( d ) information sources vary across process stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , experimentation is the dominant information source during the construction stage ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the relevance criteria show that the makers turn to people because it is pleasurable , to documents because it is easy , and to experimentation because it results in quality products ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These results emphasize the importance of experimentation and suggest that it warrants closer attention in studies of the information behavior of makers and , more broadly , creative professionals ."
Research method	Users ' access trails in terms of category sequences in click-through data are employed to mine users ' web browsing behaviors .
Research findings/conclusions	Contextual relationships of URL categories are learned by the hidden Markov model .
Research method	The top-level domains ( TLDs ) extracted from URLs themselves and the corresponding categories are caught by the TLD model .
Research method	"Given a URL to be predicted , its TLD and current context are empirically combined in an aggregation model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition to the uses of the current context , the predictions of the URL accessed previously in different contexts by various users are also considered by majority rule to improve the aggregation model ."
Research findings/conclusions	Large-scale experiments show that the advanced aggregation approach achieves promising performance while maintaining an acceptably low false positive rate .
Research questions	Different strategies are introduced to integrate the model with the blacklist it generates for filtering objectionable web pages without analyzing their content .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In practice , this is complementary to the existing content analysis from users ' behavioral perspectives ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most of the studies show that the two variables are closely related : An increasing collaboration activity ( measured in terms of number of authors , number of affiliations , and number of countries ) is associated with an increased citation impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based on the higher quality of papers that profit from more than one scientist giving expert input or other ( citation-specific ) factors ."
Research method	"Thus , the current study addresses this question by using two comprehensive data sets with publications ( in the biomedical area ) including quality assessments by experts ( F1000Prime member scores ) and citation data for the publications ."
Research method	"The study is based on more than 15,000 papers ."
Research method	"Robust regression models are used to investigate the relationship between number of authors , number of affiliations , and number of countries , respectively , and citation impact-controlling for the papers ' quality ( measured by F1000Prime expert ratings ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results point out that the effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the papers ' quality .
Research findings/conclusions	"The citation advantage is apparently not quality related ; citation-specific factors ( e.g. , self-citations ) seem to be important here ."
Research questions	"This article presents a potential solution : an empirical approach to quantitatively measure both the degree and nature of differences among disciplinary tongues through the social and epistemic terms used ( a research area we refer to as discourse epistemetrics ) , in a case study comparing dissertations in philosophy , psychology , and physics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using a support-vector model of machine learning to classify disciplines based on relative frequencies of social and epistemic terms , we were able to markedly improve accuracy over a random selection baseline ( distinguishing between disciplines with as high as 90 % accuracy ) as well as acquire sets of most indicative terms for each discipline by their relative presence or absence ."
Research findings/conclusions	These lists were then considered in light of Research findings/conclusions of sociological and epistemological studies of disciplines and found to validate the approach 's measure of social and epistemic disciplinary identities and contrasts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the Research findings/conclusions of our study , we conclude by considering the beneficiaries of research in this area , including bibliometricians , students , and science policy makers , among others , as well as laying out a research program that expands the number of disciplines , considers shifts in socio-epistemic identities over time and applies these methods to nonacademic epistemological communities ( e.g. , political groups ) ."
Research method	"This mixed-methods study investigates information value cocreation from the social informatics perspective to surface sociotechnical implications for IT design and use , since cocreation is inherently social and technology-mediated ."
Research questions	"Specifically , the cocreation of software as an information-intensive product is examined ."
Research method	Data on the cocreation of Xiaomi 's MIUI firmware were collected from two sources : 49 interviews of staff and user participants and web crawling of the cocreation platform .
Research method	"They were analyzed with interpretive analysis , topic modeling , and social network analysis for triangulation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions indicate three sociotechnical information practices co-constituted by information , IT , people , and their activities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Each practice is instrumental in rapidly and continuously converting external information into cocreated information value .
Research findings/conclusions	The adsorption information practice attracts new and diverse external information ; the absorption practice integrates external and internal information rapidly by involving users ; the desorption practice allows rapid adoption of the cocreated product so that information value can be realized and demonstrated for further cocreation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Critically analyzing these practices reveals unanticipated or paradoxical issues affecting the design and use of common cocreation technology such as discussion forums .
Research questions	It also describes the rationale provided by repositories for their decisions to control data or provide means for depositors to do so .
Research method	"Using a purposive exploratory sample , we employed content analysis of repository website documentation , a web survey of repository managers , and selected follow-up interviews to generate data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results describe the range and variation in access and use control policies and tools employed , identifying both commonalities and distinctions across repositories ."
Research method	"Using concepts from commons theory as a guiding theoretical framework , our analysis describes the following five dimensions of repository rules , or data commons boundaries : locus of decision making ( depositor vs. repository ) , degree of variation in terms of use within the repository , the mission of the repository in relation to its scholarly field , what use means in relation to specific sorts of data , and types of exclusion ."
Research questions	"Leveraging advantages of digital publishing , megajournals are characterized by large publication volume , broad interdisciplinary scope , and peer-review filters that select primarily for scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These publishing innovations are complementary and competitive vis-a-vis traditional journals .
Research method	"We analyze how megajournals ( PLOS One , Scientific Reports ) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals ( Nature , PNAS , Science ) and quasi-megajournals ( Nature Communications , PeerJ ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches , despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	These niches-defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity-are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals , there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals ."
Research findings/conclusions	The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals-including megajournals-reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science .
Research questions	Current interest has turned to making more explicit our commonly tacit knowledge processes that involve people and technology .
Research questions	"Knowledge creation , sharing , and management processes are commonly hidden , and this is even more the case regarding ignorance processes such as the denial and obfuscation of knowledge ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Understanding the construction , generation , and perpetuation of ignorance can : ( i ) provide insights into social phenomena that might otherwise seem inexplicable ( for instance , persistence of urban myths ) , and ( ii ) enable development of interventions to either facilitate ( as with privacy-sensitive material ) or combat ( as with malicious disinformation ) ignorance ."
Research questions	"Although several pressing information issues relate to ignorance , agnotology ( the study of ignorance ) has only recently entered into the information science literature ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"An agnotologic approach expands the repertoire of methods and approaches in social informatics , better enabling the field to grapple with pressing contemporary issues of mis/dis/lack of information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Using Robert Proctor 's typology of constructions of ignorance , this article describes ways that each type may be germane to and within social informatics , highlighting social informatics topics that would benefit from agnotologic exploration , and suggesting theoretical and methodological approaches useful to a social informatics of ignorance ."
Research questions	"In order to examine the influential factors that inspire dynamic and eager participation , this study investigates what motivates social media users to share their personal experiences , information , and social support with anonymous others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A variety of information-sharing activities in social media , including creating postings , photos , and videos in 5 different types of social media : Facebook , Twitter , Delicious , YouTube , and Flickr , were observed ."
Research method	"Ten factors : enjoyment , self-efficacy , learning , personal gain , altruism , empathy , social engagement , community interest , reciprocity , and reputation , were tested to identify the motivations of social media users based on reviews of major motivation theories and models ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions from this study indicate that all of the 10 motivations are influential in encouraging users ' information sharing to some degree and strongly correlate with one another .
Research findings/conclusions	"At the same time , motivations differ across the 5 types of social media , given that they deliver different information content and serve different Research questionss ."
Research findings/conclusions	Understanding such differences in motivations could benefit social media developers and those organizations or institutes that would like to use social media to facilitate communication among their community members ; appropriate types of social media could be chosen that would fit their own Research questionss and they could develop strategies that would encourage their members to contribute to their communities through social media .
Research questions	"Specifically , it articulates the nature of information practices in the lives of 14 newcomers to Canada who have migrated from the Philippines to the medium-size city of Winnipeg ."
Research method	"Using a qualitative and exploratory approach , this study applies a transnational lens to this area of research to make explicit the detailed activities and outcomes of newcomer information practices , in particular drawing out the dimensions and implications of newcomers ' participation within and across local and global social networks , translocal information landscapes , and across their settlement trajectories ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The result is a Translocal Meaning Making process that describes how newcomers come to make sense and use information across distinct and sometimes contradictory information spaces .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that migrant information practices shift across space and time and are constituted both individually , through cognitive and affective processes , and socially , through shared imaginaries , through interactions within and across translocal information landscapes , and through complex deterritorialized networks of people and resources ."
Research method	"Quantitative and qualitative textual analyses are combined to map conceptual relations in these reactions , and to explore how understandings of scholarly communication and publishing relate to specific conceptualizations of science and of the hedging of scientific knowledge ."
Research method	A discussion of the connection of trust and scientific knowledge and of the role of peer review for establishing and communicating this connection provides for the theoretical and topical framing .
Research questions	Special attention is paid to the pervasiveness of digital technologies in formal scholarly communication processes .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three dimensions of trust are traced in the material analyzed : ( a ) trust through personal experience and informal knowledge , ( b ) trust through organized , internal control , ( c ) trust through form ."
Research questions	The article concludes by discussing how certain understandings of the conditions for trust in science are challenged by perceptions of possibilities for deceit in digital environments .
Research questions	"In this study , we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective , aiming to answer two fundamental questions ."
Research questions	"One , how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers , authors , and institutions ?"
Research questions	"Two , does this influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly associations ?"
Research method	"Specifically , we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science ( WoS ) , and ran multiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles , authors , and institutions ."
Research method	We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show two key Research findings/conclusions : first , the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retraction , and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven , Research questionsful scientific misconduct ; second , this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph , but instead has a limited and localized effect ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers , authors , or institutions related to retractions ."
Research method	This exploratory mixed-methods study examines how people discuss and disclose the use of two different drugsmarijuana and opioidson Reddit .
Research method	"In this study , hermeneutic content analysis is employed to describe the type of comments people make in forums dedicated to discussions about illicit drugs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With inductive analysis , seven categories of comments were identified : disclosure , instruction and advice , culture , community norms , moralizing , legality , and banter ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our subsequent quantitative analysis indicates that although the amounts of disclosure are similar in each subreddit , there are more instances of instruction and advice in discussions about opiates , and more examples of banter in comments about marijuana use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In fact , both subreddits have high rates of banter ."
Research questions	"We argue that banter fosters disclosure in both subreddits , and that banter and disclosure are linked with information-seeking behaviors in online forums ."
Research findings/conclusions	This work has implications for future explorations of disclosure online and for public health interventions aimed at disseminating credible information about drug use to at-risk individuals .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article reports on one of the few studies of information sharing during such incidents .
Research method	Interviews drawing on the critical incident technique were conducted with offshore emergency responders and supplemented by internal organizational reports and observations of emergency response exercises .
Research questions	We propose a counterintuitive relationship between trust and information sharing .
Research questions	"We argue that better information sharing plays a crucial role in instilling or enhancing trust and that in the time-bound , uncertain , and highly volatile context of offshore emergency response , if trust collapses , then it must be rebuilt swiftly and this can be done through more effective information sharing ."
Research questions	We explore this argument using the activity theory concept of contradictions and argue that apparent contradictions in the activity system and the behavior of emergency responders should be analyzed and interpreted by taking into account crucial contextual characteristics .
Research method	"The article draws on further support from relevant literature , including that of the information science , organization , and communication fields ."
Research questions	"We present the Data Practices and Curation Vocabulary ( DPCVocab ) , a functional vocabulary created for specifying relationships among data practices in research , types of data produced and used , and curation roles and activities ."
Research method	"The vocabulary consists of 3 categoriesResearch Data Practices , Data , and Curationwith 187 terms validated through empirical studies of scientific data practices in the Earth and life sciences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The present article covers the DPCVocab development process and examines applications for mapping relationships across the 3 categories , identifying factors for projecting curation costs and important differences in curation requirements across disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As a tool for curators , the vocabulary provides a framework for charting curation options and guiding systematic administration of curation services ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It can serve as a shared terminology or lingua franca to support interactions and collaboration among curators , data producers , system developers , and other stakeholders in data infrastructure and services ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The DPCVocab as a whole supports both the technical and the human aspects of professional curation work essential to the modern research system .
Research findings/conclusions	"Without this information , it is not possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In response , a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most ( 55 % ) users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and humanities ( 42 % ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"About 85 % of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications , but some also bookmark articles for use in professional ( 50 % ) , teaching ( 25 % ) , and educational activities ( 13 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Of course , it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so these data do not represent all readers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In conclusion , Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	The mechanism can also be used to compare the same metric across different academic fields .
Research method	"The mechanism operates by selecting an optimal normalization factor and an optimal distributional adjustment for the rank-score curve , both of which are instrumental in making sound intermetric and interfield journal comparisons ."
Research questions	Ads can greatly affect user perceptions and behavior .
Research questions	"In mobile apps , ads often follow a native format : they are designed to conform in both format and style to the actual content and context of the application ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Clicking on the ad leads users to a second destination , outside of the hosting app , where the unified experience provided by native ads within the app is not necessarily reflected by the landing page the user arrives at ."
Research questions	Little is known about whether and how this type of mobile ads is impacting user experience .
Research method	"In this paper , we use both quantitative and qualitative methods to study the impact of two design decisions for the landing page of a native ad on the user experience : ( i ) native ad style ( following the style of the application ) versus a non-native ad style ; and ( ii ) pages with multimedia versus static pages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found considerable variability in terms of user experience with mobile ad landing pages when varying presentation style and multimedia usage , especially interaction between presence of video and ad style ( native or non-native ) ."
Research questions	We also discuss insights and recommendations for improving the user experience with mobile native ads .
Research method	This study uses a concrete example in an attempt to evaluate a research institute from the area of social sciences and humanities with the help of data from Google Scholar ( GS ) .
Research method	"In order to use GS for a bibliometric study , we developed procedures for the normalization of citation impact , building on the procedures of classical bibliometrics ."
Research method	"In order to test the convergent validity of the normalized citation impact scores , we calculated normalized scores for a subset of the publications based on data from the Web of Science ( WoS ) and Scopus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Even if scores calculated with the help of GS and the WoS/Scopus are not identical for the different publication types ( considered here ) , they are so similar that they result in the same assessment of the institute investigated in this study : For example , the institute 's papers whose journals are covered in the WoS are cited at about an average rate ( compared with the other papers in the journals ) ."
Research method	This article describes the construction of 6 test collections for cross-language person-entity linking that together span 22 languages .
Research method	Fully automated components were used together with 2 crowdsourced validation stages to affordably generate ground-truth annotations with an accuracy comparable to that of a completely manual process .
Research findings/conclusions	"The resulting test collections each contain between 642 ( Arabic ) and 2,361 ( Romanian ) person references in non-English texts for which the correct resolution in English Wikipedia is known , plus a similar number of references for which no correct resolution into English Wikipedia is believed to exist ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Fully automated cross-language person-name linking experiments with 20 non-English languages yielded a resolution accuracy of between 0.84 ( Serbian ) and 0.98 ( Romanian ) , which compares favorably with previously reported cross-language entity linking results for Spanish ."
Research method	"The synergy at the national level is decomposed at the level of states , Core-Based Statistical Areas ( CBSA ) , and Combined Statistical Areas ( CSA ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	We zoom in to the state of California and in more detail to Silicon Valley .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results do not support the assumption of a national system of innovations in the U.S.A .
Research findings/conclusions	"Innovation systems appear to operate at the level of the states ; the CBSA are too small , so that systemness spills across their borders ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Decomposition of the sample in terms of high-tech manufacturing ( HTM ) , medium-high-tech manufacturing ( MHTM ) , knowledge-intensive services ( KIS ) , and high-tech services ( HTKIS ) does not change this pattern , but refines it ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The East Coast-New Jersey , Boston , and New York-and California are the major players , with Texas a third one in the case of HTKIS ."
Research findings/conclusions	Chicago and industrial centers in the Midwest also contribute synergy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Within California , Los Angeles contributes synergy in the sectors of manufacturing , the San Francisco area in KIS ."
Research findings/conclusions	KIS in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area-a CSA composed of seven CBSA-spill over to other regions and even globally .
Research method	These numbers can then be compared between the institutes .
Research questions	"This study aims to present a new approach for the evaluation of citation data at the institutional level , based on regression models ."
Research method	"As example data , the study includes all articles and reviews from the Web of Science for the publication year 2003 ( n=886,416 papers ) ."
Research method	The study is based on an in-house database of the Max Planck Society .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study investigates how much the expected number of citations for a publication changes if it contains the address of an institute .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The calculation of the expected values allows , on the one hand , investigating how the citation impact of the papers of an institute appears in comparison with the total of all papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , the expected values for several institutes can be compared with one another or with a set of randomly selected publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Besides the institutes , the regression models include factors which can be assumed to have a general influence on citation counts ( e.g. , the number of authors ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is also crucial for promoting online community health by motivating participation .
Research questions	"However , how gratitude occurs and can be encouraged in online communities is not yet well understood ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This exploratory study investigated how online community users experience gratitude , focusing on how gratitude expression and acknowledgment occurs , can break down or can be reinforced ."
Research method	"Semistructured Critical Incident interviews were conducted with 8 users of various online communities , including discussion and support groups , social Q & A sites , and review sites , eliciting 17 memorable examples of giving and receiving thanks online ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions gave rise to a process model of gratitude in online communities-the gratitude cycle , which provides a detailed , holistic understanding of the experience of gratitude online that can inform the design of online community platforms that aim to motivate users to perpetuate the cycle ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An enriched understanding of gratitude in online communities can help ensure future platforms better support the expression and acknowledgment of thanks , encouraging participation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although this theory is one of the dominant models of sensemaking , it has not been extensively tested with a range of sensemaking tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	The tasks discussed here focused on making sense of structures rather than processes or narratives .
Research method	"Eleven researchers were asked to construct understanding of how a scientific community in a particular domain is organized ( e.g. , people , relationships , contributions , factors ) by exploring the concept of influence in academia ."
Research method	"This topic was chosen because , although researchers frequently handle this type of task , it is unlikely that they have explicitly sought this type of information ."
Research method	"We conducted a think-aloud study and semistructured interviews with junior and senior researchers from the human-computer interaction ( HCI ) domain , asking them to identify current leaders and rising stars in both HCI and chemistry ."
Research method	Data were coded and analyzed using the Data/Frame Model to both test and extend the model .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three themes emerged from the analysis : novices and experts ' sensemaking activity chains , constructing frames through indicators , and characteristics of structure tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	We propose extensions to the Data/Frame Model to accommodate structure sensemaking .
Research questions	"One successful collection is hosted on the TED ( Technology , Entertainment , Design ) website ."
Research method	This study uses a range of bibliometric ( citation ) and webometric ( usage and bookmarking ) indicators to examine TED videos in order to provide insights into the type and scope of their impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that TED Talks impact primarily the public sphere , with about three-quarters of a billion total views , rather than the academic realm ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Differences were found among broad disciplinary areas , with art and design videos having generally lower levels of impact but science and technology videos generating otherwise average impact for TED ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Many of the metrics were only loosely related , but there was a general consensus about the most popular videos as measured through views or comments on YouTube and the TED site ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , most videos were found in at least one online syllabus and videos in online syllabi tended to be more viewed , discussed , and blogged ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Less-liked videos generated more discussion , although this may be because they are more controversial ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Science and technology videos presented by academics were more liked than those by nonacademics , showing that academics are not disadvantaged in this new media environment ."
Research method	"By conducting a thematic analysis of four key UN policy documents related to sustainable development , this paper argues that alongside financial and other resources , access to , and use of , appropriate information are essential for achieving SDGs ."
Research method	The paper also reviews research on information and sustainability undertaken at the iSchools and the computer and human-computer interaction HCI communities .
Research questions	"Given that the mission of iSchools is to connect people and society with the required information through the use of appropriate technologies and tools , this paper argues that iSchools can play a key role in helping people , institutions , and businesses , and thus countries around the world achieve SDGs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The paper identifies 4 broad areas of teaching and research that can help iSchools around the world prepare a trained workforce who can manage , and facilitate access to , information in specific domains and contexts ."
Research questions	It is also argued that cooperation and collaborations among iSchools can promote a culture of sustainable information practices among university graduates and researchers in different disciplines that will pave the way for achieving SDGs in every sector .
Research findings/conclusions	The corporate information agency is a corporate library or an information/knowledge center .
Research questions	"CI practitioner refers to those business professionals , in various organizations , who are particularly committed to strategic and competitive intelligence analysis and production activities ."
Research method	"In this study , we administered a survey to a sample of 214 CI practitioners to ascertain the extent to which they utilize , are aware of , and perceive the usefulness of corporate information agencies provided by their organizations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With 63 valid responses , we observed high degrees of use , awareness , and perceived usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	Multiple regression results also show significant correlations between perceived usefulness and use of the corporate information agency among the responding CI practitioners .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Supported by empirical evidence , these Research findings/conclusions provide a benchmark of knowledge regarding the value of corporate information agencies in CI practices ."
Research questions	"Managing data set producer expectations and guiding future development of library services requires understanding the decisions libraries make about curatorial activities , why they make these decisions , and the effects on future data reuse ."
Research method	"We present a study , comprising interviews ( n = 43 ) and ethnographic observation , of two university libraries who partnered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) collaboration to curate a significant astronomy data set ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The two libraries made different choices of the materials to curate and associated services , which resulted in different reuse possibilities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Each of the libraries offered partial solutions to the SDSS leaders ' objectives .
Research findings/conclusions	"The libraries ' approaches to curation diverged due to contextual factors , notably the extant infrastructure at their disposal ( including technical infrastructure , staff expertise , values and internal culture , and organizational structure ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Data Transfer Process case offers lessons in understanding how libraries choose curation paths and how these choices influence possibilities for data reuse .
Research findings/conclusions	Outcomes may not match data producers ' initial expectations but may create opportunities for reusing data in unexpected and beneficial ways .
Research questions	The aim of this research was to examine the relationship between relevance criteria use and visual behavior in the context of predictive relevance judgments .
Research method	"To address this objective , a multimethod research design was employed that involved observation of participants eye movements , talk-aloud protocols , and postsearch interviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , the results reported in this article came from the analysis of 281 predictive relevance judgments made by 24 participants using the Google search engine ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We present a novel stepwise methodological framework for the analysis of relevance judgments and eye movements on the Web and show new patterns of relevance criteria use during predictive relevance judgment .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , the Research findings/conclusions showed an effect of ranking order and surrogate components ( Title , Summary , and URL ) on the use of relevance criteria ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , differences were observed in the cognitive effort spent between very relevant and not relevant judgments ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude with the implications of this study for IR research .
Research method	"Data collected covered journal impact factor ( JIF ) , number of issues per year , number of authors per article , longevity , editorial board membership , frequency of publication , number of databases indexing the journal , number of aggregators providing full-text access , country of publication , JCR categories , Dewey decimal classification , and journal statement of scope ."
Research findings/conclusions	Three features significantly correlated with JIF : number of editorial board members and number of JCR categories in which a journal is listed correlated positively ; journal longevity correlated negatively with JIF .
Research findings/conclusions	"Coword analysis of journal descriptions provided a proximity clustering of journals , which differed considerably from the clusters based on editorial board membership ."
Research method	"Finally , a multiple linear regression model was built to predict the JIF based on all the collected bibliographic features ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Thus , the current study examines some of the characteristics and motivations common among answerers , who produce health-related answers to questions asked by anonymous others in a social Q & A site , Yahoo !"
Research method	Answers .
Research method	"An online survey questionnaire was distributed to top and recent answerers to investigate their demographics , areas of health expertise , and other characteristics related to answering behaviors online ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , 10 motivation factors are proposed and tested in the survey : enjoyment , efficacy , learning , personal gain , altruism , community interest , social engagement , empathy , reputation , and reciprocity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions show that altruism is the most influential motivation , while personal gain is the least ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Enjoyment and efficacy are more influential than other social motivations , such as reputation or reciprocity , although there are some variations across different groups of answerers ."
Research method	Motivational factors among top answerers or health experts are further analyzed .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of this study have practical implications for promoting health answerers to share knowledge and experiences in social contexts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the study design of the current study can be used to examine motivations of answerers in other topic areas as well as other social contexts ."
Research method	Three hypotheses were proposed in this study .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , research collaboration increases in the post-web stage relative to the pre-web stage ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , research collaboration is positively related to research impact , operationally defined as the number of citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Lastly , the positive relationship between research collaboration and research impact is stronger in the post-web stage than that in the pre-web stage ."
Research method	Articles published in the field of information systems in both time periods were collected to test the hypotheses .
Research findings/conclusions	"The empirical results strongly support H1 and H2 , showing that co-authorship increases in the post-web stage , and positively correlates with citations received by information systems articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The positive effects of interdisciplinary collaborations and collaborations among multiple authors are enhanced in the post-web stage , but such enhancement is not found for international collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	H3 is partially supported .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the proposed HTEM , topics near the root of the hierarchy are more abstract and also evolve in the longer timescales than those near the leaves ."
Research questions	"To achieve this goal , the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process ( ddCRP ) is extended to a new nested process that is able to simultaneously model the dependencies among data and the relationship between clusters ."
Research method	"The HTEM is proposed based on the new process for time-stamped documents , in which the timestamp is utilized to measure the dependencies among documents ."
Research method	"Moreover , an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for the proposed HTEM ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our experimental results on two popular real-world data sets verify that the proposed HTEM can capture coherent topics and discover their hierarchical evolutions .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also outperforms the baseline model in terms of likelihood on held-out data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Heavy investment favoring Gold over Green OA has been associated with increased total publication costs , inequality of opportunity to publish , and concerns about integrity in science reporting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Notwithstanding current fluidity because of ongoing competition for market share between supporters of the major alternative publishing strategies , emerging trends indicate the need for material and human resources to be redirected away from Gold and toward Green OA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Doing so will reduce total publication costs , increase equality of access for authors and readers , and remove the financial incentives that have encouraged poor and corrupt publishing practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that in the beginning stage , that is , from zero to one citation , high- , medium- , and low-cited publications do not obviously exhibit different lengths of time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , in the accumulative stage , that is , from one to N citations , highly cited publications begin to receive citations much more rapidly than medium- and low-cited publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , as N increases , the difference in receiving new citations among high- , medium- , and low-cited publications increases quite significantly ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose innovative and economic methods of generating knowledge-based structural metadata ( structural keywords ) using a combination of natural language processing-based machine-learning techniques and human intelligence ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By allowing low-barrier participation through a social media system , scholars ( both as authors and users ) can participate in the metadata editing and enhancing process and benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval ."
Research method	"Our experimental web system ScholarWiki uses machine learning techniques , which automatically produce increasingly refined metadata by learning from the structural metadata contributed by scholars ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The cumulated structural metadata add intelligence and automatically enhance and update recursively the quality of metadata , wiki pages , and the machine-learning model ."
Research questions	"However , little evidence exists to provide robust methods for assessing the state of any given format technology and describing its evolution over time ."
Research method	This article introduces relevant models from diffusion theory and market research and presents a replicable analysis method to compute models of technology evolution .
Research method	Data cleansing and the combination of multiple data sources enable the application of nonlinear regression to estimate the parameters of the Bass diffusion model on format technology market lifecycles .
Research findings/conclusions	"Through its application to a longitudinal data set from the UK Web Archive , we demonstrate that the method produces reliable results and show that the Bass model can be used to describe format lifecycles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By analyzing adoption patterns across market segments , new insights are inferred about how the diffusion of formats and products such as applications occurs over time ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The analysis provides a stepping stone to a more robust and evidence-based approach to model technology evolution .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While there have been efforts at evaluating different aspects of journal impact , the dimension of knowledge trading is largely absent ."
Research method	"To fill the gap , this study employed a set of trading-based indicators , including weighted degree centrality , Shannon entropy , and weighted betweenness centrality , to assess sources ' trading impact ."
Research method	"These indicators were applied to several time-sliced source-to-source citation networks that comprise 33,634 sources indexed in the Scopus database ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that several interdisciplinary sources , such as Nature , PLoS One , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , and Science , and several specialty sources , such as Lancet , Lecture Notes in Computer Science , Journal of the American Chemical Society , Journal of Biological Chemistry , and New England Journal of Medicine , have demonstrated their marked importance in knowledge trading ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , this study also reveals that , overall , sources have established more trading partners , increased their trading volumes , broadened their trading areas , and diversified their trading contents over the past 15 years from 1997 to 2011 ."
Research findings/conclusions	These results inform the understanding of source-level impact assessment and knowledge diffusion .
Research method	"Using the Science Citation Index Expanded , we looked at the yearly percentages of lifetime citations of papers published in 1990 first cited in review articles in 1992 and 1995 in the field of biomedical research , and found that no significant change occurred after citation in a review article , regardless of the papers ' citation activity or specialty ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Additional comparison was done for papers from the field of clinical research , and this yielded no meaningful results to support the notion that review articles have any substantial effect on the citation count of the papers they review ."
Research questions	We describe the knowledge loss that occurs when information is aggregated across diverse ontologies into databases or archives relying on a single schema and use a series of illustrative examples demonstrate the significance of this information loss for policy design and implementation .
Research findings/conclusions	"While there are important gains from information aggregation across ontologies , the potential trade-offs involved in creating large-scale databases are significant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The differences between locally constituted ways of knowing and the organizing ontology used for larger scale databases affects the extent to which these collections , or knowledge banks , provide accurate guidance for policy and action ."
Research method	"The article draws on insights from information science and social science to discuss two classes of socio-technical approaches for overcoming information loss at the interface between ontologies : first , technology-enabled efforts to soften ontological interfaces by making data open , unconstructed , and available and/or creating ontologies collaboratively and , second , organizational changes that reduce the need for information to cross interfaces , such as reconstructing knowledge platforms to be more interactive , thereby decentralizing decision-making ."
Research findings/conclusions	The framing of the challenges involved in building large-scale knowledge banks as a matter of ontology mismatch creates an opportunity for an interdisciplinary and analytically integrated research agenda to implement and test these potential approaches .
Research method	The metadata usage ratio is introduced as a means of assessing the usage of a popular tag as metadata .
Research method	"We also compare how popular tags are used as image tags or metadata in the Flickr general collection and the Library of Congress 's photostream ( LCP ) , also in Flickr ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Flickr popular tags in the list overall are categorically stable , and the changes that do appear reflect Flickr users ' evolving technology-driven cultural experience ."
Research findings/conclusions	The popular tags in Flickr had a high number of generic objects and specific locations-related tags and were rarely at the abstract level .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , the popular tags in the LCP describe more in the specific objects and time categories ."
Research method	"Flickr users copied the Library of Congress-supplied metadata that related to specific objects or events and standard bibliographic information ( e. g. , author , format , time references ) as popular tags in the LCP ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Those popular tags related to generic objects and events showed a high metadata usage ratio , while those related to specific locations and objects showed a low image metadata usage ratio ."
Research findings/conclusions	Popular tags in Flickr appeared less frequently as image metadata when describing specific objects than specific times and locations for historical images in Flickr LCP collections .
Research findings/conclusions	"Understanding how people contribute image tags or image metadata in Flickr helps determine what users need to describe and query images , and could help improve image browsing and retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	Constructing such a patent network requires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents in the patent classification systems .
Research questions	"Despite the existence of various distance measures in the literature , it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them , and which ones to select for constructing patent technology network maps ."
Research questions	This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of such technology maps .
Research questions	"Herein , we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps ."
Research method	"Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) system , we compare 12 representative distance measures , which quantify interfield knowledge base proximity , field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents , and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our comparative analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized coreference and inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives .
Research questions	"Searchers who are learning often exhibit exploratory behaviors , and so current research is often focused on improving support for exploratory search ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Consequently , we need effective measures of learning to demonstrate better support for exploratory search ."
Research questions	"Some approaches , such as quizzes , measure recall when learning from a fixed source of information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research , however , focuses on techniques for measuring open-ended learning , which often involve analyzing handwritten summaries produced by participants after a task ."
Research method	There are two common techniques for analyzing such summaries : ( a ) counting facts and statements and ( b ) judging topic coverage .
Research findings/conclusions	"Both of these techniques , however , can be easily confounded by simple variables such as summary length ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents a new technique that measures depth of learning within written summaries based on Bloom 's taxonomy ( B.S .
Research questions	Bloom & M.D .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Engelhart , 1956 ) ."
Research method	This technique was generated using grounded theory and is designed to be less susceptible to such confounding variables .
Research method	"Together , these three categories of measure were compared by applying them to a large collection of written summaries produced in a task-based study , and our results provide insights into each of their strengths and weaknesses ."
Research findings/conclusions	Both fact-to-statement ratio and our own measure of depth of learning were effective while being less affected by confounding variables .
Research findings/conclusions	Recommendations and clear areas of future work are provided to help continued research into supporting sensemaking and learning .
Research method	This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007-2014 modeling the TCP .
Research findings/conclusions	"It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward , with payments projected to increase further ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing , these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing ( Gold OA ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable , there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , hybrid subscription/OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most APCs were paid to large traditional commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income .
Research findings/conclusions	New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably .
Research findings/conclusions	"The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions , in 2013 already constituting an average of 10 % of the TCP ( excluding administrative costs ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Essential to developing such systems are a description of expert search behavior and an understanding of how it may be acquired .
Research method	The present study contributes a detailed analysis of the query behavior of 10 students as they completed assigned exercises during a semester-long course on expert search .
Research method	"Detailed query logs were coded for three dimensions of query expression : the information structure searched , the type of query term used , and intent of the query with respect to specificity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Patterns of query formulation were found to evidence a progression of instruction , suggesting that the students gained knowledge of fundamental system-independent constructs that underlie expert search , and that domain-independent search expertise may be defined as the ability to use these constructs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications for system design are addressed .
Research questions	"However , prior studies placed a great emphasis on proactive knowledge behaviors , such as knowledge sharing and contribution , but failed to consider the uniqueness of knowledge withholding ."
Research method	"To capture the social-deviant nature of knowledge withholding and to better understand how people deal with counterproductive knowledge behaviors , this study develops a research model based on the secondary control perspective ."
Research method	Empirical analyses were conducted using the data collected from an online knowledge space .
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that both predictive control and vicarious control exert a positive influence on knowledge withholding .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study also incorporates knowledge-withholding acceptability as a moderating variable of secondary control strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , knowledge-withholding acceptability enhances the impact of predictive control , whereas it weakens the effect of vicarious control on knowledge withholding ."
Research questions	"This study concludes with a discussion of the key Research findings/conclusions , and the implications for both research and practice ."
Research questions	This phenomenon has intensified the competition among service providers for user loyalty .
Research questions	"There were plenty of studies investigating user loyalty in the mobile-app context ; nevertheless , most failed to identify those true loyalty users who embraced attitudinal and behavioral loyalty ."
Research questions	"To address this research gap , this study aims to understand and predict user loyalty by an extended RFD model ."
Research method	"We propose that recency , frequency , and duration are able to reflect behavioral loyalty , while category frequency rate and category duration rate are representations of attitudinal loyalty ."
Research method	"Using the actual data collected from a third-party app , we calculate the weights of each variable through the entropy weight method , evaluate users ' loyalty in two dimensions , and classify users into four groups ( i.e. , true loyalty , latent loyalty , moderate loyalty , and no loyalty ) ."
Research method	We also conduct a dynamic analysis to investigate how users move across different loyalty conditions .
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that majority of users tend to stay on their initial loyalty conditions .
Research findings/conclusions	"For those who have changed their loyalty conditions , it is found that true loyalty users are more likely to become latent loyalty users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The most straightforward percentile-based indicator is the proportion of frequently cited publications , for instance , the proportion of publications that belong to the top 10 % most frequently cited of their field ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Recently , more complex percentile-based indicators have been proposed ."
Research findings/conclusions	A difficulty in the calculation of percentile-based indicators is caused by the discrete nature of citation distributions combined with the presence of many publications with the same number of citations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We introduce an approach to calculating percentile-based indicators that deals with this difficulty in a more satisfactory way than earlier approaches suggested in the literature .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We show in a formal mathematical framework that our approach leads to indicators that do not suffer from biases in favor of or against particular fields of science .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there are websites dedicated to individual universes , the information found on these sites separate out the various formats , concentrate on only the bibliographic aspects of the material , and are only searchable with full text ."
Research findings/conclusions	We have created an ontological model that will allow various user groups interested in transmedia to search for and retrieve the information contained in these worlds based upon their structure .
Research method	"We conducted a domain analysis and user studies based on the contents of Harry Potter , Lord of the Rings , the Marvel Universe , and Star Wars in order to build a new model using Ontology Web Language ( OWL ) and an artificial intelligence-reasoning engine ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This model can infer connections between transmedia properties such as characters , elements of power , items , places , events , and so on ."
Research findings/conclusions	This model will facilitate better search and retrieval of the information contained within these vast story universes for all users interested in them .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The result of this project is an OWL ontology reflecting real user needs based upon user research , which is intuitive for users and can be used by artificial intelligence systems ."
Research method	This article presents a study that investigates tweets related to 5 major library and information science ( LIS ) professional organizations in the United States .
Research method	"This study applies a systematic tweets analysis framework , including descriptive analytics , network analytics , and co-word analysis of hashtags ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions shed light on user engagement with LIS professional organizations and the trending discussion topics on Twitter , which is valuable for enabling more successful social media use and greater influence ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Earlier research found that participants employed voice search much less frequently than keyboard search .
Research findings/conclusions	The main reasons that participants disliked voice search are system mistakes and the inability to modify queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"In keyboard search , query reformulation is facilitated by partial query modification , which is not supported by most of the current voice search systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Consequently , users need to speak the complete query in voice search even with only minor changes ."
Research questions	This article focuses on examining partial query modification during voice search through a Wizard of Oz user experiment .
Research questions	It examines if users would prefer partial query modification and how they perform it in voice search .
Research method	Thirty-two participants participated in the experiment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results indicated that when given the opportunity , the users performed more partial query modifications than complete queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Common partial query modification strategies and patterns emerged from the experiment .
Research findings/conclusions	The results can be used to improve the voice search system design and benefit the research community in general .
Research findings/conclusions	System implications and future work were discussed .
Research questions	"In the context of information , privilege , and community , politics of marginalization drive stigmatized groups to develop collective norms for locating , sharing , and hiding information ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we investigate the information practices of a subcultural community whose activities are both stigmatized and of uncertain legal status : the extreme body modification community ."
Research method	"We use the construct of information poverty to analyze the experiences of 18 people who had obtained , were interested in obtaining , or had performed extreme body modification procedures ."
Research questions	"With a holistic understanding of how members of this community use information , we complicate information poverty by working through concepts of stigma and community norms ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our research contributes to human information behavior scholarship on marginalized groups and to Internet studies research on how communities negotiate collective norms of information sharing online .
Research method	"Lexical translation evidence is assembled from Wikipedia and from a large machine-readable dictionary , statistical translation evidence is drawn from parallel corpora , and evidence from co-occurrence in the document language provides a basis for limiting the adverse effect of translation ambiguity ."
Research findings/conclusions	Coverage statistics for NII Testbeds and Community for Information Access Research ( NTCIR ) queries confirm that these resources have complementary strengths .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments with translation evidence from a small parallel corpus indicate that even rather rough estimates of translation probabilities can yield further improvements over a strong technique for translation weighting based on using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a term-association measure .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , a novel approach to posttranslation query expansion using a random walk over the Wikipedia concept link graph is shown to yield further improvements over alternative techniques for posttranslation query expansion ."
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results on the NTCIR-5 English-Korean test collection show statistically significant improvements over strong baselines .
Research findings/conclusions	"It finds that , first , 4 groups , instead of a binary haves versus have-nots , best characterize Chinese urban society informationally ; second , the distribution of people among these groups conforms to normal distribution , in striking contrast with the pyramid-shaped socioeconomic structure of Chinese society ; third , although the demographic characteristics of these groups suggest a significant correlation between people 's informational and socioeconomic statuses , the 2 are far from identical ; fourth , although the 4 groups differ in all aspects investigated , they differ most notably in information assets and the range and type of materials they choose as their regular information resources ; fifth , although the 4 groups vary significantly , each differs from the others in its own way ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study concludes that society 's informational and socioeconomic structures are 2 related but distinctive structures , and that the informational structure is characterized by highly complicated textures of inequality ."
Research questions	Increasing numbers of these are being developed in digital curation .
Research findings/conclusions	Their central role in strategic decision making raises the need to evaluate their fitness for this Research questions and develop guidelines for their design and evaluation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A comprehensive review of assessment frameworks , however , found little evidence that existing assessment frameworks have been evaluated systematically , and no methods for their evaluation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes a new methodology for evaluating the design and use of assessment frameworks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It builds on prior research on maturity models and combines analytic and empirical evaluation methods to explain how the design of assessment frameworks influences their application in practice , and how the design process can effectively take this into account ."
Research method	We present the evaluation methodology and its application to two frameworks .
Research findings/conclusions	The evaluation results lead to guidelines for the design process of assessment frameworks in digital curation .
Research findings/conclusions	The methodology provides insights to the designers of the evaluated frameworks that they can consider in future revisions ; methodical guidance for researchers in the field ; and practical insights and words of caution to organizations keen on diagnosing their abilities .
Research findings/conclusions	Complex noun phrases and even sentences can be turned into a hashtag .
Research questions	Breaking hashtags into their words is a challenging task due to the irregular and compact nature of the language used in Twitter .
Research questions	"In this study , we investigate feature-based machine learning and language model ( LM ) -based approaches for hashtag segmentation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that LM alone is not successful at segmenting nontrivial hashtags .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , when the N-best LM-based segmentations are incorporated as features into the feature-based approach , along with context-based features proposed in this study , state-of-the-art results in hashtag segmentation are achieved ."
Research method	"In addition , we provide an analysis of over two million distinct hashtags , autosegmented by using our best configuration ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis reveals that half of all 60 million hashtag occurrences contain multiple words and 80 % of sentiment is trapped inside multiword hashtags , justifying the need for hashtag segmentation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , we analyze the grammatical structure of hashtags by parsing them and observe that 77 % of the hashtags are noun-based , whereas 11.9 % are verb-based ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although both have been investigated to discover whether they correlate with article citations , it is not known whether users tend to tweet or save ( in Mendeley ) the same kinds of articles that they cite ."
Research method	"In response , this article compares pairs of articles that are tweeted , saved to a Mendeley library , or cited by the same user , but possibly a different user for each source ."
Research method	"The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles published in 2012 , with minimum tweeted ( 10 ) , saved to Mendeley ( 100 ) , and cited ( 10 ) thresholds ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show surprisingly minor overall overlaps between the three phenomena .
Research findings/conclusions	The importance of journals for Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics .
Research findings/conclusions	"The moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments , but sensitivity is needed for underlying differences ."
Research method	"A series of data sets are examined and joined in order to analyze the citations of over 195,000 conference papers and 108,000 journal papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	Two means of evaluating the citations of journals and conferences are explored : h ( 5 ) and average citations per paper ; it was found that h ( 5 ) has certain biases that make it a difficult measure to use ( despite it being the main measure used by Google Scholar ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results from the analysis show that CS , as a discipline , values conferences as a publication venue more highly than any other academic field of study ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis also shows that a small number of elite CS conferences have the highest average paper citation rate of any publication type , although overall , citation rates in conferences are no higher than in journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is also shown that the length of a paper is correlated with citation rate .
Research findings/conclusions	"These cases illustrate different diffusion characteristics of academic knowledge , depending on the nature of the knowledge in the new publications ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work adds to the study of the development of science and links this development to citation analysis .
Research questions	"The problem is that while many journals are assigned to a single subfield , many others are assigned to several ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article discusses a multiplicative and a fractional strategy to deal with this situation .
Research method	"The empirical part studies different aspects of citation distributions under the two strategies , namely : the number of articles , the mean citation rate , the broad shape of the distribution , their characterization in terms of size- and scale-invariant indicators of high and low impact , and the presence of extreme distributions , that is , distributions that behave very differently from the rest ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that , despite large differences in the number of articles according to both strategies , the similarity of the citation characteristics of articles published in journals assigned to one or several subfields guarantees that choosing one of the two strategies may not lead to a radically different picture in practical applications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , the characterization of citation excellence through a high-impact indicator may considerably differ depending on that choice ."
Research method	Simon and Derek John de Solla Price .
Research findings/conclusions	"These models each have 2 distinct aspects : growth , which is the introduction of new articles , and preferential attachment , which describes how established articles accumulate new citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The attachment rules are the subtle portion of these models that supply the interesting explanatory power .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous treatments included both aspects .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Here we separate preferential attachment from the growth aspect of the model .
Research findings/conclusions	This separation allows us to examine the results of the preferential attachment rules without confounding these with growth in the number of articles available to receive citations .
Research method	We introduce the method using Markov chains .
Research method	We show how to overcome the mathematical and computational complexity to obtain results .
Research method	A comparison of Simon 's and Price 's rules are computed in 3 JournalCitationReports subject categories using articles published in the 1960s and allowed to accumulate citations to 1980 .
Research findings/conclusions	This comparison can not be made through analysis of power laws .
Research questions	We extended the Speech Act Theory ( SAT ) to this context by developing the Dialog Conversion Model ( DCM ) that elucidates the characteristics of online dialog between shoppers and retailers .
Research method	We validated the DCM using quantitative and qualitative data .
Research findings/conclusions	"The quantitative analyses of 1,185 communication sessions and related purchase records reflect that shoppers ' cognitive , rather than affective , expressions tend to indicate their purchase intentions , and retailers should emphasize cognitive expressions to the extent possible while being strategic in their choice of expressions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the affective expressions ( in positive and negative forms ) articulated by retailers have a considerable influence on purchase conversion ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the same is not true for shoppers ."
Research method	Post-hoc interviews were conducted with shoppers to gain additional insights .
Research questions	"This article aims to map the landscape of research in this area , evaluate the current maturity of knowledge on this central question in DP and provide direction for future research ."
Research method	"To do so , this paper reviews assessment frameworks in digital preservation through a systematic literature search and categorizes the literature by type of research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis shows that publication output around assessment in digital preservation has increased markedly over time , but most existing work focuses on developing new models rather than rigorous evaluation and validation of existing frameworks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Significant gaps are present in the application of robust conceptual foundations and design methods , and in the level of empirical evidence available to enable the evaluation and validation of assessment models ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis and comparison with other fields suggest that the design of assessment models in DP should be studied rigorously in both theory and practice , and that the development of future models will benefit from applying existing methods , processes , and principles for model design ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	A proposal for such a measure by Bartolucci is improved .
Research method	"In the first bootstrap stage , a collection of high-precision features is used to bootstrap a training set with positive and negative examples of coreferring authors ."
Research method	A supervised feature-based classifier is then trained on the bootstrap clusters and used to cluster the authors in a larger unlabeled dataset .
Research findings/conclusions	Our self-supervised approach shares the advantages of unsupervised approaches ( no need for expensive hand labels ) as well as supervised approaches ( a rich set of features that can be discriminatively trained ) .
Research method	"The algorithm disambiguates 54,000,000 author instances in Thomson Reuters ' Web of Knowledge with B3 F1 of.807 ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We analyze parameters and features , particularly those from citation networks , which have not been deeply investigated in author disambiguation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The most important citation feature is self-citation , which can be approximated without expensive extraction of the full network ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the supervised stage , the minor improvement due to other citation features ( increasing F1 from.748 to.767 ) suggests they may not be worth the trouble of extracting from databases that do n't already have them ."
Research findings/conclusions	A lean feature set without expensive abstract and title features performs 130 times faster with about equal F1 .
Research questions	"Every day , Internet users with similar information needs have the potential to collaborate ."
Research questions	"However , online search is typically performed in solitude ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Existing search systems do not promote explicit collaborations , and collaboration opportunities ( collabportunities ) are missed ."
Research questions	"In this article , we describe a method to evaluate the feasibility of transforming these collabportunities into recommendations for explicit collaboration ."
Research method	We developed a technique called pseudocollaboration to evaluate the benefits and costs of collabportunities through simulations .
Research method	"We evaluate the performance of our method using three data sets : ( a ) data from single users ' search sessions , ( b ) data with collaborative search sessions between pairs of searchers , and ( c ) logs from a large-scale search engine with search sessions of thousands of searchers ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results establish when and how collabportunities would significantly help or hinder the search process versus searches conducted individually .
Research findings/conclusions	The method that we describe has implications for the design and implementation of recommendation systems for explicit collaboration .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It also connects system-mediated and user-mediated collaborative search , whereby the system evaluates the likely benefits of collaborating for a search task and helps searchers make more informed decisions on initiating and executing such a collaboration ."
Research method	"To investigate how users categories search engine results , we perform several experiments where users are asked to group a list of 20 search results into several categories , while attaching a relevance judgment to each formed category ."
Research method	"Moreover , to determine how users change their minds over time , each experiment was repeated three times under the same conditions , with a gap of one month between rounds ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that on average users form 4-5 categories .
Research findings/conclusions	Within each round the size of a category decreases with the relevance of a category .
Research method	"To measure the agreement between the search engine 's ranking and the users ' relevance judgments , we defined two novel similarity measures , the average concordance and the MinMax swap ratio ."
Research findings/conclusions	Similarity is shown to be the highest for the third round as the users ' opinion stabilizes .
Research findings/conclusions	"Qualitative analysis uncovered some interesting points that users tended to categories results by type and reliability of their source , and particularly , found commercial sites less trustworthy , and attached high relevance to Wikipedia when their prior domain knowledge was limited ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , the lack of strict orthographic standards ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , diachronic and geographical variations in Spanish from the 12th to 15th century ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this period , named entities usually appear as complex text structure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , it was frequent to add nicknames and information about the persons role in society and geographic origin ."
Research method	"To tackle this complexity , named entity recognition and classification system has been implemented ."
Research method	The system uses contextual cues based on semantics to detect entities and assign a type .
Research method	"Given the occurrence of entities with attached attributes , entity contexts are also parsed to determine entity-type-specific dependencies for these attributes ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it uses a variant generator to handle the diachronic evolution of Spanish medieval terms from a phonetic and morphosyntactic viewpoint ."
Research method	"The tool iteratively enriches its proper lexica , dictionaries , and gazetteers ."
Research method	"The system was evaluated on a corpus of over 3,000 manually annotated entities of different types and periods , obtaining F1 scores between 0.74 and 0.87 ."
Research method	Attribute annotation was evaluated for a person and role name attributes with an overall F1 of 0.75 .
Research questions	Social tagging systems can simplify the involvement of a large number of users and improve the metadata-generation process .
Research questions	Current research is exploring social tagging systems as a mechanism to allow nonprofessional catalogers to participate in metadata generation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Because social tags are not from controlled vocabularies , there are issues that have to be addressed in finding quality terms to represent the content of a resource ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research explores ways to obtain a set of tags representing the resource from the tags provided by users .
Research method	Two metrics are introduced .
Research questions	Annotation Dominance ( AD ) is a measure of the extent to which a tag term is agreed to by users .
Research questions	Cross Resources Annotation Discrimination ( CRAD ) is a measure of a tag 's potential to classify a collection .
Research questions	It is designed to remove tags that are used too broadly or narrowly .
Research method	"Using the proposed measurements , the research selects important tags ( meta-terms ) and removes meaningless ones ( tag noise ) from the tags provided by users ."
Research method	"To evaluate the proposed approach to find classificatory metadata candidates , we rely on expert users ' relevance judgments comparing suggested tag terms and expert metadata terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that processing of user tags using the two measurements successfully identifies the terms that represent the topic categories of web resource content .
Research findings/conclusions	The suggested tag terms can be further examined in various usages as semantic metadata for the resources .
Research questions	"The discussion grapples with the ambiguous relationship between digitizations and their exemplars in the well-known database , Early English Books Online ( EEBO ) , and suggests ways in which digitizations might be analyzed as witnesses of current perceptions about the past and used accordingly in scholarly research ."
Research findings/conclusions	The article therefore offers a critical reading of EEBO and its digitizations as part of a broader effort to investigate the role of digitally encoded resources in the transmission of ideas and the production of cultural heritage .
Research value/outlook/limitations	A novel porn-detection framework that can find newly appearing pornographic web pages by mining search query logs is proposed .
Research method	"First , suspected queries are identified along with their clicked URLs by an automatically constructed lexicon ."
Research method	"Then , a candidate URL is determined if the number of clicks satisfies majority voting rules ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , a candidate whose URL contains at least one categorical keyword will be included in a blacklist ."
Research method	Several experiments are conducted on an MSN search porn dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method .
Research findings/conclusions	The resulting blacklist generated by our search-intent-based method achieves high precision ( 0.701 ) while maintaining a favorably low false-positive rate ( 0.086 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"The experiments of a real-life filtering simulation reveal that our proposed method with its accumulative update strategy can achieve 44.15 % of a macro-averaging blocking rate , when the update frequency is set to 1 day ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the overblocking rates are less than 9 % with time change due to the strong advantages of our search-intent-based method ."
Research findings/conclusions	This user-behavior-oriented method can be easily applied to search engines for incorporating only implicit collective intelligence from query logs without other efforts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In practice , it is complementary to intelligent content analysis for keeping up with the changing trails of objectionable websites from users ' perspectives ."
Research method	"Liu , Kim , and Creel ( 2015 ) ( denoted LKC15 ) developed a 21-item search task difficulty reason scheme using a controlled laboratory experiment ."
Research method	The current study simplified the scheme through another experiment that followed the same design as LKC15 and involved 32 university students .
Research findings/conclusions	The study had one added questionnaire item that provided a list of the 21 difficulty reasons in the multiple-choice format .
Research method	"By comparing the current study with LKC15 , a concept of primary top difficulty reasons was proposed , which reasonably simplified the 21-item scheme to an 8-item top reason list ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This limited number of reasons is more manageable and makes it feasible for search systems to predict task difficulty reasons from observable user behaviors , which builds the basis for systems to improve user satisfaction based on predicted search difficulty reasons ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper unites these theories by examining how individual privacy preferences impact context-dependent privacy expectations .
Research questions	The paper theorizes that experience provides a bridge between individuals ' general privacy attitudes and nuanced contextual factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"This leads to the hypothesis that , when making judgments about privacy expectations , individuals with less experience in a context rely more on individual preferences such as their generalized privacy beliefs , whereas individuals with more experience in a context are influenced by contextual factors and norms ."
Research method	"To test this hypothesis , 1,925 American users of mobile applications made judgments about whether varied real-world scenarios involving data collection and use met their privacy expectations ."
Research findings/conclusions	Analysis of the data suggests that experience using mobile applications did moderate the effect of individual preferences and contextual factors on privacy judgments .
Research findings/conclusions	Experience changed the equation respondents used to assess whether data collection and use scenarios met their privacy expectations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Discovering the bridge between 2 dominant theoretical models enables future privacy research to consider both personal and contextual variables by taking differences in experience into account .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among others , the number of retweets ( RTs ) and user types are the two important items of analysis for understanding the transmission of information on Twitter ."
Research method	"To analyze this point , we applied text classification and feature extraction experiments using random forests machine learning with conventional stylistic and Twitter-specific features ."
Research method	"We first collected tweets from 40 accounts with a high number of followers and created tweet texts from 28,756 tweets ."
Research method	"We then conducted 15 types of classification experiments using a variety of combinations of features such as function words , speech terms , Twitter 's descriptive grammar , and information roles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We deliberately observed the effects of features for classification performance .
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicated that class classification per user indicated the best performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , we observed that certain features had a greater impact on classification ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the case of the experiments that assessed the level of RT quantity , information roles had an impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the case of user experiments , important features , such as the honorific postpositional particle and auxiliary verbs , such as desu and masu , had an impact ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research clarifies the features that are useful for categorizing tweets according to the number of RTs and user types .
Research findings/conclusions	Only a comparison with the performance of all other institutions makes it possible to say exactly where an institution stands .
Research findings/conclusions	"In order to interpret the results of the SCImago Institutions Ranking ( based on Scopus data ) and the Leiden Ranking ( based on Web of Science data ) , in this study we offer thresholds with which it is possible to assess whether an institution belongs to the top 1 % , top 5 % , top 10 % , top 25 % , or top 50 % of institutions in the world ."
Research method	The thresholds are based on the excellence rate or PPtop 10 % .
Research findings/conclusions	Both indicators measure the proportion of an institution 's publications which belong to the 10 % most frequently cited publications and are the most important indicators for measuring institutional impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , while an institution must achieve a value of 24.63 % in the Leiden Ranking 2013 to be considered one of the top 1 % of institutions worldwide , the SCImago Institutions Ranking requires 30.2 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	The two ways of achieving OA are self-archiving of scientific work by the authors ( Green OA ) and publishing in OA journals ( Gold OA ) .
Research questions	But there is still no consensus which model should be supported in particular .
Research questions	The aim of this simulation study is to discover mechanisms and predict developments that may lead to specific outcomes of possible market transformation scenarios .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It contributes to theories related to OA by substantiating the argument of a citation advantage of OA articles and by visualizing the mechanisms of a journal system collapsing in the long-term due to the continuation of the serials crisis .
Research findings/conclusions	"The practical contribution of this research stems from the integration of all market players : Decisions regarding potential financial support of OA models can be aligned with our Research findings/conclusions , as well as the decision of a publisher to migrate his/her journals to Gold OA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results indicate that for scholarly communication in general , a transition to Green OA combined with a certain level of subscription-based publishing and a migration of few top journals is the most beneficial development ."
Research findings/conclusions	GIBIR provides an effective way to retrieve bibliographic information .
Research method	The system represents bibliographic information as networks and provides a form-based query interface .
Research findings/conclusions	Users can develop their queries interactively by referencing the system-generated graph queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"Complex queries such as papers on information retrieval , which were cited by John 's papers that had been presented in SIGIR can be effectively answered by the system ."
Research method	We evaluate the proposed system by developing another relational database-based bibliographic information retrieval system with the same interface and functions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiment results show that the proposed system executes the same queries much faster than the relational database-based system , and on average , our system reduced the execution time by 72 % ( for 3-node query ) , 89 % ( for 4-node query ) , and 99 % ( for 5-node query ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In their tweets , users often reveal their location information and short-term visiting histories or plans ."
Research findings/conclusions	Capturing user 's short-term activities could benefit many applications for providing the right context at the right time and location .
Research questions	"In this paper we are interested in extracting locations mentioned in tweets at fine-grained granularity , with temporal awareness ."
Research method	"Specifically , we recognize the points-of-interest ( POIs ) mentioned in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited , is currently at , or will soon visit the mentioned POIs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A POI can be a restaurant , a shopping mall , a bookstore , or any other fine-grained location ."
Research method	"Our proposed framework , named TS-Petar ( Two-Stage POI Extractor with Temporal Awareness ) , consists of two main components : a POI inventory and a two-stage time-aware POI tagger ."
Research method	The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of the Foursquare community .
Research findings/conclusions	"It contains both POIs ' formal names and their informal abbreviations , commonly observed in Foursquare check-ins ."
Research method	"The time-aware POI tagger , based on the Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) model , is devised to disambiguate the POI mentions and to resolve their associated temporal awareness accordingly ."
Research method	"Three sets of contextual features ( linguistic , temporal , and inventory features ) and two labeling schema features ( OP and BILOU schemas ) are explored for the time-aware POI extraction task ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our empirical study shows that the subtask of POI disambiguation and the subtask of temporal awareness resolution call for different feature settings for best performance .
Research method	We have also evaluated the proposed TS-Petar against several strong baseline methods .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage approach achieves the best accuracy and outperforms all baseline methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency .
Research findings/conclusions	The popularity of well-known packages and corresponding large numbers of citations received bear testimony of the contribution of scientific software to academic research .
Research questions	Yet software is not generally recognized as an academic outcome .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this study , a usage-based model is proposed with varied indicators including citations , mentions , and downloads to measure the importance of scientific software ."
Research method	"We performed an investigation on a sample of international bioinformatics research articles , and on a sample from the Chinese community ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis shows that scientists in the field of bioinformatics rely heavily on scientific software : the major differences between the international community and the Chinese example being how scientific packages are mentioned in publications and the time gap between the introduction of a package and its use .
Research findings/conclusions	Biologists publishing in international journals tend to apply the latest tools earlier ; Chinese scientists publishing in Chinese tend to follow later .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , journals with higher impact factors tend to publish articles applying the latest tools earlier ."
Research questions	"Researchers and practitioners have both touted the benefits and warned of the drawbacks associated with data science and big data approaches , but few studies investigate how data science is carried out on the ground ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we first review the hype and criticisms surrounding data science and big data approaches ."
Research method	We then present the Research findings/conclusions of semistructured interviews with 18 data analysts from various industries and organizational roles .
Research method	"Using qualitative coding techniques , we evaluated these interviews in light of the hype and criticisms surrounding data science in the popular discourse ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that although the data analysts we interviewed were sensitive to both the allure and the potential pitfalls of data science , their motivations and evaluations of their work were more nuanced ."
Research questions	"We conclude by reflecting on the relationship between data analysts ' work and the discourses around data science and big data , suggesting how future research can better account for the everyday practices of this profession ."
Research questions	"In this article , we study the example of adverse selection of reviewers when a potential referee whose ability is his private information faces a finite sequence of review processes for several scholarly journals , one after the other ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our editor 's problem is to design a system that guarantees that each manuscript is reviewed by a referee if and only if the reviewer 's ability matches the review 's complexity .
Research method	"As is typically the case in solving problems of adverse selection in agency theory , the journal editor offers a menu of contracts to the potential referee , from which the reviewer chooses the contract that is best for him given his ability ."
Research findings/conclusions	The optimal contract will be the one that provides the right incentives to match the complexity of the review and the ability of the reviewer .
Research method	"The payment of contracts is made through a proportional increment of the reviewer factor , which measures the importance of reviewers to their field ."
Research questions	"In this article , we present the results of a preliminary study of cyberlearning projects funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) that address these issues ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our work demonstrates that text-mining tools can be used to partially automate the process of finding NSF 's cyberlearning awards and characterizing the fine-grained topics implicit in award abstracts .
Research findings/conclusions	The methodology we have established to assess NSF 's cyberlearning investments should generalize to other areas of research and other repositories of public-access documents .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that data set mentions and citations varied greatly among disciplines in terms of how data sets were collected , referenced , and curated ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While a majority of articles provided free access to data , formal ways of data attribution such as DOIs and data citations were used in a limited number of articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , data reuse took place in less than 30 % of the publications that used data , suggesting that researchers are still inclined to create and use their own data sets , rather than reusing previously curated data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of how data sets are used in science and helps institutions and publishers make useful data policies .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although some scholars have recognized the gatekeeping role of review usefulness , whereby consumers always follow useful reviews , this is the first study that attempts to provide a better understanding of the gatekeeping role of review valence ."
Research questions	"Drawing on loss aversion theory , we propose that review valence provides more diagnostic value than review usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Its crucial role is demonstrated in that only when reviews are perceived as positive do highly useful ( rather than lowly useful ) reviews increase consumers ' adoption of them , whereas the difference appears less evident when reviews are perceived as negative ."
Research method	We empirically test the model from two perspectives including product level and review level .
Research method	The results of a mixed-method approach - a large-scale panel study ( product level ) followed by two experimental studies ( review level ) - provide empirical evidence for the above hypotheses .
Research method	"Relevance is defined as a Relationship ( R ) between an Information Object ( I ) and an Information Need ( N ) ( which consists of Topic , User , Problem/Task , and Situation/ Context ) with focus on R. This defines Relevance-as-is ( conceptual relevance , strong relevance ) ."
Research method	"To determine relevance , an Agent A ( a person or system ) operates on a representation I of the information object and a representation N of the information need , resulting in relevance-as-determined ( operational measure of relevance , weak relevance , an approximation ) ."
Research method	Retrieval tests compare relevance-as-determined by different agents .
Research method	This article discusses and compares two major approaches to conceptualizing relevance : the entityfocused approach ( focus on elaborating the entities involved in relevance ) and the relationship-focused approach ( focus on explicating the relational nature of relevance ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The article argues that because relevance is fundamentally a relational construct the relationshipfocused approach deserves a higher priority and more attention than it has received .
Research method	The article further elaborates on the elements of the framework with a focus on clarifying several critical issues on the discourse on relevance .
Research method	Citation data were obtained using text extraction from a collection of PDF files with significant manual postprocessing performed to clean up the results .
Research method	Manual annotation of the references was then performed to complete the citation network .
Research method	"We analyzed the networks of paper citations , author citations , and author collaborations in an attempt to identify the most central papers and authors ."
Research method	"The analysis includes general network statistics , PageRank , metrics across publication years and venues , the impact factor and h-index , as well as other measures ."
Research questions	Social media has thus become a rich and real-time source for various kinds of public opinion and sentiment studies .
Research questions	"According to psychology and neuroscience , human emotions are known to be strongly dependent on sensory perceptions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although sensation is the most fundamental antecedent of human emotions , prior works have not looked into their relation to emotions based on social media texts ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we report the results of our study on sensation effects that underlie human emotions as revealed in social media ."
Research method	"We focus on the key five types of sensations : sight , hearing , touch , smell , and taste ."
Research questions	We first establish a correlation between emotion and sensation in terms of linguistic expressions .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Then , in the second part of the paper , we define novel features useful for extracting sensation information from social media ."
Research method	"Finally , we design a method to classify texts into ones associated with different types of sensations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The sensation dataset resulting from this research is opened to the public to foster further studies .
Research findings/conclusions	"Practice is inherently embodied too , which means embodiment can be utilized as a vantage point to seek conceptual grounding for the rather diverse range of theories and models in information behavior research ."
Research questions	The challenge then is to articulate in what ways and on what levels a particular approach contributes to advancing information behavior research .
Research findings/conclusions	Conceptual clarity would also help information behavior models and theories developed in libraries and information science become more accessible and hopefully also more relevant to researchers in cognate disciplines .
Research questions	We investigate the current practices of media studies researchers and how these practices affect their research questions .
Research method	Through the analysis of 27 interviews about the research practices of media studies researchers during a research project we developed a model of the activities in their research cycle .
Research findings/conclusions	We find that information gathering and analysis activities are dominating the research cycle .
Research findings/conclusions	These activities influence the research outcomes as they determine how research questions asked by media studies researchers evolve .
Research questions	"Specifically , we show how research questions are related to the availability and accessibility of data as well as new information sources for contextualization of the research topic ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our contribution is a comprehensive account of the overall research cycle of media studies researchers as well as specific aspects of the research cycle , i.e. , information sources , information seeking challenges , and the development of research questions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This work confirms Research findings/conclusions of previous work in this area using a previously unstudied group of researchers , as well as providing new details about how research questions evolve ."
Research questions	Many studies have investigated the emergence of information grounds in public places .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study pays attention to the emergence , peak , and abeyance of an online information ground ."
Research questions	"It investigates a Facebook group used by youth for sharing information when misinformation spread wildly during the 2011 violence in Ambon , Indonesia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions demonstrate change and continuity in an online information ground ; it became an information hub when reaching a peak cycle , and an information repository when entering into abeyance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite this period of nonactivity , the friendships and collective memories resulting from information ground interactions last over time and can be used for reactivating the online information ground when new needs emerge ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Illuminating the lifecycles of an online information ground , the Research findings/conclusions have potential to explain the dynamic of users ' interactions with others and with information in quotidian spaces ."
Research findings/conclusions	This critical evaluation may be beyond the capabilities of students from primary and secondary school .
Research method	"We conducted 2 studies to assess how students from primary , secondary , and undergraduate education perceive and use 2 relevant credibility cues in forums : author 's identity and evidence used to support his answer ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Students did n't use these cues when they evaluated forums with a single answer ( Experiment 1 ) , but they recommended more often answers from self-reported experts than from users with a pseudonym when multiple sources were discussed in the forum ( Experiment 2 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This pattern of results suggested that multiple viewpoints increase students ' attention to source features in forum messages .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiment 2 also revealed that primary school students preferred personal experience as evidence in the messages , whereas undergraduate students preferred the inclusion of documentary sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , while children mimic the adult preference for expert sources in web forums , they treat source information in a rather superficial manner ."
Research questions	"To conclude , we outline possible mechanisms to understand how credibility assessment evolves across educational levels , and discuss potential implications for the educational curriculum in information literacy ."
Research questions	Climate change research has become more interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary as a typical Mode-2 science that is also dependent on an application context for its further development .
Research findings/conclusions	We propose to approach interdisciplinarity as a co-construction of the knowledge base in the reference patterns and the programmatic focus in the editorials in the core journal of the climate-change sciencesClimaticChangeduring the period 1977-2013 .
Research method	"First , we analyze the knowledge base of the journal and map journal-journal relations on the basis of the references in the articles ."
Research questions	"Second , we follow the development of the programmatic focus by analyzing the semantics in the editorials ."
Research questions	"We argue that interdisciplinarity is a result of the co-construction between different agendas : The selection of publications into the knowledge base of the journal , and the adjustment of the programmatic focus to the political context in the editorials ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show a widening of the knowledge base from referencing the multidisciplinary journals Nature and Science to citing journals from specialist fields .
Research method	The programmatic focus follows policy-oriented issues and incorporates public metaphors .
Research findings/conclusions	This index can be applied to both researchers and journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , we show that it fills the gap of the h-index and similar measures that do not take into account the effect of self-citations for authors or journals impact evaluation ."
Research method	"We provide 2 real-world examples : First , we evaluate the research impact of the most productive scholars in computer science ( according to DBLP Computer Science Bibliography , Universitat Trier , Trier , Germany ) ; then we revisit the impact of the journals ranked in the Computer Science Applications section of the SCImago Journal & Country Rank ranking service ( Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas , University of Granada , Extremadura , Madrid , Spain ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We observe how self-citations , in many cases , affect the rankings obtained according to different measures ( including h-index and ch-index ) , and show how the proposed measure mitigates this effect ."
Research questions	Previous social tagging studies have collected social tagging data and analyzed how tagging functions as a tool to organize and retrieve information .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Many studies focused on the patterns of tagging rather than the users ' perspectives .
Research method	"To provide a more comprehensive picture of users ' social tagging activities in institutional collections , and how this compares to social tagging in a more personal context , we collected data from social tagging users by surveying 7,563 participants in the Library of Congress 's Flickr Collection ."
Research method	We asked users to describe their motivations for activities within the LC Flickr Collection in their own words using open-ended questions .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , we identified 11 motivations using a bottom-up , open-coding approach : affective reactions , opinion on photo , interest in subject , contribution to description , knowledge sharing , improving findability , social network , appreciation , personal use , and personal relationship ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our study revealed that affective or emotional reactions play a critical role in the use of social tagging of institutional collections by comparing our Research findings/conclusions to existing frameworks for tagging motivations .
Research questions	We also examined the relationships between participants ' occupations and our 11 motivations .
Research method	"We divide them into two categories , social Q & A ( SQA ) and virtual reference ( VR ) , and examine how experts ( librarians ) and end users ( students ) evaluate information within both categories ."
Research method	"To accomplish this , we first performed an extensive literature review and compiled a list of the aspects found to contribute to a good answer ."
Research method	"These aspects were divided among three high-level concepts : relevance , quality , and satisfaction ."
Research method	"We then interviewed both experts and users , asking them first to reflect on their online Q & A experiences and then comment on our list of aspects ."
Research findings/conclusions	These interviews uncovered two main disparities .
Research findings/conclusions	"One disparity was found between users expectations with these services and how information was actually delivered among them , and the other disparity between the perceptions of users and experts with regard to the aforementioned three characteristics of relevance , quality , and satisfaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using qualitative analyses of both the interviews and relevant literature , we suggest ways to create better hybrid solutions for online Q & A and to bridge the gap between experts and users understandings of relevance , quality , and satisfaction , as well as the perceived importance of each in contributing to a good answer ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research empirically tested a taxonomy of functional units in a prototype journal system .
Research method	"This taxonomy was developed by identifying functions of the smallest information units within four journal article components ( i.e. , introduction , methods , results , discussion ) , and their associations with information tasks of using journal articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experimental results show that functional units can be utilized in supporting navigation , close reading , comprehension , and information use of journal articles to various extents ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results provide evidence that an individual functional unit has varying relevance to information use tasks , and has varying relevance to other functional units in the same or another component for a particular task ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research suggests that the information within a journal article can be organized and presented by functions to enhance effectiveness and efficiency in reading process and reading outcome .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This qualitative study examines the practices of decision makers as they engage with DSS-DD at a large U.S. Midwestem university and uncovers the socio-technical characteristics that lead to limited or non-use of dashboards .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To examine these practices and characteristics , this study presents a framework grounded in socio-technical interaction networks from social informatics and sociomateriality from information systems that explores the socio-technical practices of users within organizations , while acknowledging the impact of the users ' socio-technical contexts on their DSS-DD practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that during the design and implementation phases of these dashboards the institutional contexts that the dashboards are meant to inform are often ignored ; and that as users interact with these systems they develop unintended and shadow practices that lead to limited or non-use of the dashboards for decision making Research questionss .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , the study finds that users ' practices are influenced by their local socio-technical networks , which includes their prior experiences using institutional data , other actors within their institutional unit , and the political and social contexts which shape the users ' decision making behavior and data-use practices ."
Research questions	"The goal of this study was to determine how to better facilitate satisfaction through shared leadership , individual trust , and autonomy ."
Research questions	"Specifically , in this study we sought a better understanding of the effects of shared leadership , team members ' trust , and autonomy on satisfaction ."
Research method	We conducted a study with 163 individuals in 44 virtual teams .
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that shared leadership facilitates satisfaction in virtual teams both directly and indirectly through the promotion of trust .
Research findings/conclusions	Shared leadership moderated the relationships of individual trust and individual autonomy with satisfaction .
Research findings/conclusions	Team-level satisfaction was a strong predictor of virtual team performance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We discuss these Research findings/conclusions and the implications for theory and design .
Research questions	"We study the effect of search assistance , operationalized as an interactive faceted query suggestion , for both whole-session effectiveness and engagement through interactive faceted query suggestion ."
Research method	"A user experiment is reported , where users performed exploratory search tasks , comparing interactive faceted query suggestion and a control condition with only conventional typed-query interaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	Data comprised of interaction and search logs show that the availability of interactive faceted query suggestion substantially improves whole-session effectiveness by increasing recall without sacrificing precision .
Research findings/conclusions	"The increased engagement with interactive faceted query suggestion is targeted to direct situated navigation around the initial query scope , but is not found to improve individual queries on average ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results imply that research in exploratory search should focus on measuring and designing tools that engage users with directed situated navigation support for improving whole-session performance .
Research questions	"Driven by a classic approach to defining concepts , scholars have not been able to agree on a unified definition of privacy ."
Research questions	This poses a barrier to those who seek to implement privacy through their decisions .
Research questions	A critical component of their work involves anticipating and responding to potential privacy risks .
Research findings/conclusions	"In choosing one definition over another , practitioners might be missing nuanced contextual overlaps that bear on privacy and thus bias their subsequent decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For these practical endeavors , it is important to adopt an inclusive and rich definition ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Such a definition should also be responsive to how those affected by decisions that might compromise privacy , namely citizens and technology users , conceive of privacy ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The present paper applies a prototype perspective on privacy that acknowledges the fuzziness of concepts and goes on to develop such a definition in a series of empirical studies .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The relevance of the privacy prototype is then explored as it applies to privacy theorists , practitioners , and methodologists , suggesting new avenues for future research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results demonstrate that an increase in the number of authors leads to an increase in impact , from the beginning of the last century onward , and that this is not due simply to self-citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	A similar trend is also observed for the number of addresses and number of countries represented in the byline of an article .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the constant inflation of collaboration since 1900 has resulted in diminishing citation returns : Larger and more diverse ( in terms of institutional and country affiliation ) teams are necessary to realize higher impact ."
Research questions	The article concludes with a discussion of the potential causes of the impact gain in citations of collaborative papers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To address this gap , this article reports on the study of the information behavior and related activities of older persons during natural disasters ."
Research method	"Based on a qualitative study , we draw on the theory of information worlds to study the key activities of preparing , responding , and recovering from disasters ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The article contributes to the information behavior literature by developing a more informed understanding of both the interrelationship between the information worlds and activities of older persons , and how older persons seek and share information during disasters ."
Research questions	"The goal of subjective language identification is to determine that a private state is expressed , without considering its polarity or specific emotion ."
Research questions	"A component of word meaning , Personal Sense , has clear potential in the field of subjective language identification , as it reflects a meaning of words in terms of unique personal experience and carries personal characteristics ."
Research questions	In this paper we investigate how Personal Sense can be harnessed for the Research questions of identifying subjectivity in news titles .
Research questions	"In the process , we develop a new Personal Sense annotation framework for annotating and classifying subjectivity , polarity , and emotion ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Personal Sense framework yields high performance in a fine-grained subsentence subjectivity classification .
Research findings/conclusions	Our experiments demonstrate lexico-syntactic features to be useful for the identification of subjectivity indicators and the targets that receive the subjective Personal Sense .
Research findings/conclusions	"In some text , however , opinion words are absent or highly ambiguous ."
Research findings/conclusions	The resulting implicit opinions are more difficult to extract and label than explicit ones .
Research method	"In this paper , cutting-edge machine-learning approaches - deep neural network and word-embedding - are adopted for implicit opinion mining at the snippet and clause levels ."
Research method	Hotel reviews written in Chinese are collected and annotated as the experimental data set .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show the convolutional neural network models not only outperform traditional support vector machine models , but also capture hidden knowledge within the raw text ."
Research method	The strength of word-embedding is also analyzed .
Research findings/conclusions	There is a trend toward using common repositories with many organizations encouraging workers to use GIM to avoid duplication of files and management .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"So far , PIM and GIM have been studied by different research communities , so their effectiveness for file retrieval has not yet been systematically compared ."
Research method	We compared PIM and GIM in a large-scale elicited personal information retrieval study .
Research method	"We asked 275 users to retrieve 860 of their own shared files , testing the effect of sharing method on success and efficiency of retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	Participants preferred PIM over GIM .
Research findings/conclusions	"More important , PIM retrieval was more successful : Participants using GIM failed to find 22 % of their files compared with 13 % failures using PIM ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This may be because active organization aids retrieval : When using personally created folders , the failure percentage was 65 % lower than when using default folders ( e.g. , My Documents ) , and more than 5 times lower than when using folders created by others for GIM ."
Research method	Theoretical reasons for this are discussed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The novelty of our approach lies in the exploitation of the Web page PageRank values as indicators of the significance the different senses of a term carry when employed in search queries .
Research questions	We also aim at scalable query sense resolution techniques that can be applied without loss of efficiency to large data sets such as those on the Web .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our experimental Research findings/conclusions validate that the proposed techniques perform more accurately than do the traditional disambiguation strategies and improve the quality of the search results , when involved in query expansion ."
Research findings/conclusions	"User tags on documents in a social bookmarking site reflect a user 's views of an information object , which can augment the content description and provide more effective representation of information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study presents a study of tag analysis to uncover semantic relations among tag terms implicit in user tagging .
Research questions	The objective was to identify the syntagmatic semantic cores of topic and comment in user tags evidenced by the meaning attached to the information object by users .
Research method	"The study focused on syntagmatic relations , which were based on the way in which terms were used within the information content among users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Analysis of descriptive tag terms found three primary categories of concepts : content-topic , content-comment , and context of use ."
Research method	The relations among terms within a group and between the content-topic and content-comment groups were determined by inferring user meaning from the user notes and from the context of the source text .
Research findings/conclusions	"Intergroup relations showed syntagmatic associations between the topic and comment , whereas intragroup relations were more general but were limited in the document context ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions are discussed with regard to the semantics of concepts and relations in user tagging .
Research findings/conclusions	An implication of syntagmatic relations to information search suggests that concepts can be combined by a specific association in the context of the actual use of terms .
Research findings/conclusions	Author profiles can be useful for evaluation Research questionss once the advantages and the shortcomings of these services are described and taken into consideration .
Research method	"In total , 771 personal profiles appearing in both the MAS and the GSC databases were analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that the GSC profiles include more documents and citations than those in MAS but with a strong bias toward the information and computing sciences , whereas the MAS profiles are disciplinarily better balanced ."
Research findings/conclusions	MAS shows technical problems such as a higher number of duplicated profiles and a lower updating rate than GSC .
Research findings/conclusions	It is concluded that both services could be used for evaluation proposes only if they are applied along with other citation indices as a way to supplement that information .
Research method	This article examines variability in data and metadata practices using institutions as the key theoretical concept .
Research questions	"Institutions , in the sense used here , are stable patterns of human behavior that structure , legitimize , or delegitimize actions , relationships , and understandings within particular situations ."
Research method	"Based on prior conceptualizations of institutions , a theoretical framework is presented that outlines 5 categories of institutional carriers for data practices : ( a ) norms and symbols , ( b ) intermediaries , ( c ) routines , ( d ) standards , and ( e ) material objects ."
Research questions	"These institutional carriers are central to understanding how scientific data and metadata practices originate , stabilize , evolve , and transfer ."
Research method	"This institutional framework is applied to 3 case studies : the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing ( CENS ) , the Long Term Ecological Research ( LTER ) network , and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ( UCAR ) ."
Research questions	These cases are used to illustrate how institutional support for data and metadata management are not uniform within a single organization or academic discipline .
Research questions	"Instead , broad spectra of institutional configurations for managing data and metadata exist within and across disciplines and organizations ."
Research questions	This has raised doubts about its usefulness for predicting future scientific achievements .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Here , I investigate a variant that considers only recent publications and is therefore more useful in academic hiring processes and for the allocation of research resources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is simply defined in analogy to the usual h-index , but takes into account only publications from recent years , and it can easily be determined from the ISI Web of Knowledge ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Goodreads has tens of millions of book reviews , recommendations , and ratings that may help librarians and readers to select relevant books ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article describes a first investigation of the properties of Goodreads users , using a random sample of 50,000 members ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that about three quarters of members with a public profile are female , and that there is little difference between male and female users in patterns of behavior , except for females registering more books and rating them less positively ."
Research findings/conclusions	Goodreads librarians and super-users engage extensively with most features of the site .
Research findings/conclusions	"The absence of strong correlations between book-based and social usage statistics ( e.g. , numbers of friends , followers , books , reviews , and ratings ) suggests that members choose their own individual balance of social and book activities and rarely ignore one at the expense of the other ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Goodreads is therefore neither primarily a book-based website nor primarily a social network site but is a genuine hybrid , social navigation site ."
Research questions	This feature is essentially used for two Research questionss : to capture query terms proximity or to boost the weight of terms appearing in some parts of a document .
Research questions	"In this paper , we are interested in this second category ."
Research questions	"We propose two novel query-independent techniques based on absolute term positions in a document , whose goal is to boost the weight of terms appearing in the beginning of a document ."
Research findings/conclusions	The first one considers only the earliest occurrence of a term in a document .
Research method	The second one takes into account all term positions in a document .
Research method	"We formalize each of these two techniques as a document model based on term position , and then we incorporate it into a basic language model ( LM ) ."
Research method	"Two smoothing techniques , Dirichlet and Jelinek-Mercer , are considered in the basic LM ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments conducted on three TREC test collections show that our model , especially the version based on all term positions , achieves significant improvements over the baseline LMs , and it also often performs better than two state-of-the-art baseline models , the chronological term rank model and the Markov random field model ."
Research method	"The students listed their topic and thesis in the proposal , and information in support of their thesis ."
Research questions	The study 's focus is this topic-to-thesis transition .
Research method	The study 's conceptual framework is Kuhlthau 's six stage ISP Model 's transition from exploring information in Stage 3 to formulating a focus or personal perspective on the assignment topic in Stage 4 .
Research findings/conclusions	Our study coding scheme identifies elements of the students ' implicit knowledge in the 16 proposals .
Research method	"To validate implicit knowledge as a predictor of successful student performance , implicit knowledge was coded , scored , and then the correlation coefficient was established between the score and the students ' instructors ' marks ."
Research findings/conclusions	In Part 2 of the study we found strong and significant association between the McGill coding scores and the instructors ' marks for the 16 proposals .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study is a first step in identifying , operationalizing , and testing user-centered implicit knowledge elements for future implementation in interactive information systems designed for middle school students researching a thesis-objective history assignment ."
Research method	"It is a measure for informational intents , which handles both binary and graded relevance ."
Research questions	stems from the observation that searching is currently a that searching is currently taken for granted and it is natural for users to assume that search engines are available and work well .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a consequence , users may assume the utility they have in finding relevant documents , which is the focus of traditional measures , as granted ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the contrary , they may feel uneasy when the system returns nonrelevant documents because they are then forced to do additional work to get the desired information , and this causes avoidable effort ."
Research questions	"The latter is the focus of , which evaluates the effectiveness of a system from the point of view of the effort required to the users to retrieve the desired information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide a formal definition of , a demonstration of its properties , and introduce the notion of effort/gain plots , which complement traditional utility-based measures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By means of an extensive experimental evaluation , is shown to grasp different aspects of system performances , to not require extensive and costly assessments , and to be a robust tool for detecting differences between systems ."
Research method	"This study evaluated academics ' receptiveness to information proposed by a mobile app , the SerenA Notebook : information that is based in their inferred interests but does not relate directly to a prior recognized need ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The evaluated app aimed at creating the experience of serendipitous encounters : generating ideas and inspiring thoughts , and potentially triggering follow-up actions , by providing users with suggestions related to their work and leisure interests ."
Research method	We studied how 20 academics interacted with messages sent by the mobile app ( 3 per day over 10 consecutive days ) .
Research method	Collected data sets were analyzed using thematic analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that contextual factors ( location , activity , and focus ) strongly influenced their responses to messages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Academics described some unsolicited information as interesting but irrelevant when they could not make immediate use of it .
Research findings/conclusions	They highlighted filtering information as their major struggle rather than finding information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some messages that were positively received acted as reminders of activities participants were meant to be doing but were postponing , or were relevant to ongoing activities at the time the information was received ."
Research questions	"It can be very efficient in conveying quantitative ( and sometimes qualitative ) information that can be difficult to read within one or two sentences , but which is too simple to present within a regular table ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although this format has been used in the scientific literature , and indeed recommended in some sources , its effectiveness has not been studied in formal surveys ."
Research method	This article presents the results of one such survey in which three examples were considered .
Research method	"Scientists representing mathematics , statistics , and similar disciplines and scientists representing biology , agriculture , and similar disciplines were asked to participate in the survey ; 189 representing the former and 201 representing the latter agreed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results clearly showed for both groups , when the data presented were suitable for such a layout , that the text tables were much preferred to the original sentences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The main conclusion from this work , therefore , is that scientific authors should use text tables whenever appropriate ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study finds that while the women investigators ' presence in NIH grants is generally low , higher women investigator presence is on average related to slightly lower number of publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	This study finds empirically that women investigators elect to work in fields in which fewer publications per million-dollar funding is the norm .
Research findings/conclusions	"For fields where women investigators are relatively well represented , they are as productive as men ."
Research findings/conclusions	The overall lower productivity of women investigators may be attributed to the low representation of women in high productivity fields dominated by men investigators .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The Research findings/conclusions shed light on possible reasons for gender disparity in grant productivity .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We introduce and formalize the concept of co-utility as the property that any pair of recommended items has of being useful to a user , and exploit it to improve collaborative filtering recommendations ."
Research method	"We present different techniques to estimate co-utility probabilities , all of them independent of content information , and compare them with each other ."
Research method	"We use these probabilities , as well as normalized predicted ratings , in an instance of an NP-hard problem termed the Max-Sum Dispersion Problem ( MSDP ) ."
Research method	A solution to MSDP hence corresponds to a set of items for recommendation .
Research method	We study one heuristic and one exact solution to MSDP and perform comparisons among them .
Research method	We also contrast our solutions ( the best heuristic to MSDP ) to different baselines by comparing the ratings users give to different recommendations .
Research findings/conclusions	We obtain expressive gains in the utility of recommendations and our solutions also recommend higher-rated items to the majority of users .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we show that our co-utility solutions are scalable in practice and do not harm recommendations ' diversity ."
Research method	Twenty-three participants were interviewed about their definitions of and relationships with digital possessions to identify the most salient characteristics of digital possessions and to inform preservation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions indicate that digital possessions are characterized as ( a ) providing evidence of the individual , ( b ) representing the individual 's identity , ( c ) being recognized as having value , and ( d ) exhibiting a sense of bounded control ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , archival concepts of primary , secondary , and intrinsic values provide the frame for the defining characteristics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although several Research findings/conclusions from this study are consistent with former studies of material possessions and digital possessions , this study expands research in the area using the concept of digital possessions to inform preservation and by applying archival principles of value ."
Research findings/conclusions	Understanding the nature of the individual and digital item relationship provides potential to explore new areas of reference and outreach services in libraries and archives .
Research questions	"As the nature of archival and library reference services evolves , some scholars have predicted that archives and libraries will play a part in helping individuals manage their personal collections An exploration of individuals ' relationships with their digital possessions can serve as a starting point at which scholars can explore the potential of personal information management consulting as a new area of reference and information services , specifically for the preservation of personal digital material ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Popular or influential users tweet their status and are retweeted , mentioned , or replied to by their audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	Sentiment analysis of the tweets by popular users and their audience reveals whether the audience is favorable to popular users .
Research method	"We analyzed over 3,000,000 tweets mentioning or replying to the 13 most influential users to determine audience sentiment ."
Research findings/conclusions	Twitter messages reflect the landscape of sentiment toward its most popular users .
Research method	We used the sentiment analysis technique as a valid popularity indicator or measure .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we distinguished between the positive and negative audiences of popular users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we found that the sentiments expressed in the tweets by popular users influenced the sentiment of their audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Third , from the above two Research findings/conclusions we developed a positive-negative measure for this influence ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , using a Granger causality analysis , we found that the time-series-based positive-negative sentiment change of the audience was related to the real-world sentiment landscape of popular users ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We believe that the positive-negative influence measure between popular users and their audience provides new insights into the influence of a user and is related to the real world .
Research questions	"This article discusses how young people might interact with , and be affected by , CEM ."
Research method	The article first considers the effect of CEM on young victims abused to generate the material .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It then explains the paucity of data regarding the prevalence with which young people view CEM online , inadvertently or deliberately ."
Research method	"New analyses are presented from a 2010 study of search terms entered on an internationally popular peer-to-peer website , isoHunt ."
Research method	"Over 91 days , 162 persistent search terms were recorded ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most of these related to file sharing of popular movies , music , and so forth ."
Research findings/conclusions	Thirty-six search terms were categorized as specific to a youth market and perhaps a child market .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , 4 deviant , and persistent search terms were found , 3 relating to CEM and the fourth to bestiality ."
Research questions	"The article discusses whether the existence of CEM on a mainstream website , combined with online subcultural influences , may normalize the material for some youth and increase the risk of onset ( first deliberate viewing ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among other things , the article proposes that future research examines the relationship between onset and sex offending by youth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , existing bibliometric indices are computed based on the number of citations received by each article , but they do not consider the frequency with which individual citations are mentioned in an article ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We use citation mention to denote a unique occurrence of a cited reference mentioned in the citing article , and thus some citations may have more than one mention in an article ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to our analysis of the ACL Anthology Network corpus in the natural language processing field , more than 40 % of cited references have been mentioned twice or in corresponding citing articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We argue that citation mention is a preferable for representing the citation relationships between articles , that is , a reference article mentioned m times in the citing article will be considered to have received m citations , rather than one citation ."
Research method	"Based on this assumption , we revise the h-index and propose a new bibliometric index , the WL-index , to evaluation an individual 's scientific impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to our empirical analysis , the proposed WL-index more accurately discriminates between program committee chairs of reputable conferences and ordinary authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are a number of CDR types , however , and the effectiveness of facilitation efforts will require sensitivity to that diversity ."
Research method	This article presents a method characterizing a spectrum of CDR designed to inform facilitation efforts that relies on bibliometric techniques and citation data .
Research questions	"We illustrate its use by the Toolbox Project , an ongoing effort to enhance cross-disciplinary communication in CDR teams through structured , philosophical dialogue about research assumptions in a workshop setting ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Toolbox Project workshops have been conducted with more than 85 research teams , but the project 's extensibility to an objectively characterized range of CDR collaborations has not been examined ."
Research method	"To guide wider application of the Toolbox Project , we have developed a method that uses multivariate statistical analyses of transformed citation proportions from published manuscripts to identify candidate areas of CDR , and then overlays information from previous Toolbox participant groups on these areas to determine candidate areas for future application ."
Research findings/conclusions	The approach supplies 3 results of general interest : 1 .
Research value/outlook/limitations	A way to employ small data sets and familiar statistical techniques to characterize CDR spectra as a guide to scholarship on CDR patterns and trends .
Research findings/conclusions	2 .
Research findings/conclusions	A model for using bibliometric techniques to guide broadly applicable interventions similar to the Toolbox .
Research findings/conclusions	3 .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A method for identifying the location of collaborative CDR teams on a map of scientific activity , of use to research administrators , research teams , and other efforts to enhance CDR projects ."
Research method	A typical discussion thread consists of a sequence of posts posted by multiple users .
Research findings/conclusions	"Each post in a thread serves a different Research questions providing different types of information and , thus , may not be equally useful for all applications ."
Research questions	Identifying the Research questions and nature of each post in a discussion thread is thus an interesting research problem as it can help in improving information extraction and intelligent assistance techniques .
Research method	"We study the problem of classifying a given post as per its Research questions in the discussion thread and employ features based on the post 's content , structure of the thread , behavior of the participating users , and sentiment analysis of the post 's content ."
Research method	We evaluate our approach on two forum data sets belonging to different genres and achieve strong classification performance .
Research questions	We also analyze the relative importance of different features used for the post classification task .
Research findings/conclusions	"Next , as a use case , we describe how the post class information can help in thread retrieval by incorporating this information in a state-of-the-art thread retrieval model ."
Research method	"We use a novel data set of manually extracted and coded data on the funding acknowledgements of 7,510 publications representing UK cancer research in the year 2011 and compare these reference data with funding data provided by Web of Science ( WoS ) and MEDLINE/PubMed ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions show high recall ( around 93 % ) of WoS funding data .
Research findings/conclusions	"By contrast , MEDLINE/ PubMed data retrieved less than half of the UK cancer publications acknowledging at least one funder ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , both databases have high precision ( +90 % ) : That is , few cases of publications with no acknowledgment to funders are identified as having funding data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nonetheless , funders acknowledged in UK cancer publications were not correctly listed by MEDLINE/PubMed and WoS in around 75 % and 32 % of the cases , respectively ."
Research method	"Reference data on the UK cancer research funding system are used as a case study to demonstrate the utility of funding data for strategic intelligence applications ( e.g. , mapping of funding landscape and co-funding activity , comparison of funders ' research portfolios ) ."
Research questions	"However , there is little empirical evidence on the adoption and use of consumer electronics by backpackers , nor the implications this has for their habits , practices , and interactions ."
Research method	"We investigate long-distance backpackers ' articulations with mobile information technology during the TGO Challenge , a coast-to-coast crossing of the Scottish Highlands ."
Research method	"By employing mixed methods , we explore how and why backpackers use such technology when planning and undertaking their journeys via a survey ( n = 116 ) , pre- and post-challenge interviews with selected TGO participants , and daily in-field video-logs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results suggest many advantages to using technology in this context , including fluidity of communications and access , while noting that reliance on technology is leading to issues such as increased need for battery power management , and deskilling ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions highlight implications for the juxtaposition between outdoor recreation , information behavior , and human computer interaction ( HCI ) and suggest future work in this area ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In tweet messages , URLs to web resources and hashtags are often included ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study investigates the potential of the hyperlinks and hashtags as topical clues and indicators to tweet messages .
Research method	"For this study , we crawled and analyzed about 1.5 million tweets for a 3-month period covering any topic or subject ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions of this study revealed a power law relationship for the ranking and frequency of ( a ) the host names of URLs , and ( b ) a pair of hashtags and URLs that appeared in the tweet messages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study also discovered that the most popular URLs used in tweets come from news and media websites , and a majority of the hyperlinked resources are news web pages ."
Research findings/conclusions	One implication of this study is that Twitter users are becoming more active in sharing already published information than producing new information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , our investigation on hashtags for web resource indexing reveals that hashtags have the potential to be used as indexing terms for co-occurring URLs in the same tweet ."
Research questions	We also discuss the implications of this study for web resource recommendation .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions support our theoretical hypotheses that an institution 's research resources are positively related to its central position in the network .
Research findings/conclusions	"Astronomical institutions with superior resources , such as being equipped with international observational facilities and having substantial research manpower , tend to have more foreign partners ( high degree centrality ) and play an influential role ( high betweenness centrality ) in the international collaboration network ."
Research questions	An institution becomes more and more active in international collaborations as its research population expands .
Research findings/conclusions	"In terms of the relationship , which is captured by an actor institution 's co-authorship preference for each partner in the network , the effect of research resources is not as significant as expected ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that astronomical institutions are not necessarily preferentially co-authoring with partners that have better research resources .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , this study indicates that geographic closeness ( or geographic proximity ) largely affects the occurrence of international collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	The investigated institutions apparently prefer partners from neighboring countries .
Research findings/conclusions	This finding gives an indication of the phenomenon of regional homophily in the international collaboration network .
Research method	"Specifically , the conceptual model integrates the fundamental attributes of the canonical AL service together with those more relevant of the new and widely considered AL Electronic Service ( e-services ) ."
Research method	"As concerns the evaluation approach , it incorporates the Fuzzy Sets Theory ( FST ) so as to deal with the students ' uncertainty over their own judgments on the AL service quality and a Structural Equation Model ( SEM ) to validate the conceptual model and to determine the key drivers of the AL service quality ."
Research method	The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved by an empirical study concerning the AL of the Polytechnic School of the University of Palermo ( Italy ) .
Research method	"Data collected via a survey involving more than 600 students are used , and the key drivers of the AL service quality are found out ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Particularly , the obtained results reveal that Collections and materials represents the main driver of the AL service quality followed by Infrastructure and Access to the service , whereas Staff plays the fundamental role of interface between AL service aspects and students ' needs and necessities ."
Research questions	A number of works have tried to uncover this hidden intellectual structure by analyzing citation contexts .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , none of them analyzed by document logical structures such as sections ."
Research questions	The two major goals of this study are to find characteristics of authors who are highly cited section-wise and to identify the differences in section-wise author networks .
Research method	"This study uses 29,158 of research articles culled from the ACL Anthology , which hosts articles on computational linguistics and natural language processing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the distribution of citations across sections is skewed and that a different set of highly cited authors share distinct academic characteristics , according to their citation locations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the author networks based on citation context similarity reveal that the intellectual structure of a domain differs across different sections ."
Research method	"We analyze whether a paper has a higher citation rate when it is published in one of the large publisher nations , the U.S. , U.K. , or the Netherlands , compared to a hypothetical situation when the same paper is published in journals of different origin ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This would constitute a free lunch , which could be explained by a Matthew effect visible on the country-level , similar to the well-documented Matthew effect on the author-level ."
Research method	We first use a simulation model that highlights increasing citation returns to quality as the central key condition on which such a Matthew effect may emerge .
Research findings/conclusions	"Then we use an international bibliometric panel data set of forty-nine countries for the years 2000-2010 and show that such a free lunch implied by this Matthew effect can be observed for top journals from the U.S. and depending on the specification also from the U.K. and the Netherlands , while there is no effect for lower-ranked American journals and negative effects for lower-ranked British journals as well as those coming from the Netherlands ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From the use of individual measures to the use of multiple features from different sources ( multimodality ) , studies have shown the feasibility to automatically detect whether a document is relevant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite promising results , it is not clear yet to what extent multimodality constitutes an effective approach compared to unimodality ."
Research questions	"In this article , we hypothesize that it is possible to build unimodal models capable of outperforming multimodal models in the detection of perceived relevance ."
Research method	"To test this hypothesis , we conducted three experiments to compare unimodal and multimodal classification models built using a combination of 24 features ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our classification experiments showed that a univariate unimodal model based on the left-click feature supports our hypothesis .
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , our prediction experiment suggests that multimodality slightly improves early classification compared to the best unimodal models ."
Research questions	"Based on our results , we argue that the feasibility for practical applications of state-of-the-art multimodal approaches may be strongly constrained by technology , cultural , ethical , and legal aspects , in which case unimodality may offer a better alternative today for supporting relevance detection in interactive information retrieval systems ."
Research questions	"However , although the amount of published data continues to grow and terms such as data deluge and big data today characterize numerous ( research ) initiatives , much work is still needed in the direction of publishing data in order to make them effectively discoverable , available , and reusable by others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Several barriers hinder data publishing , from lack of attribution and rewards , vague citation practices , and quality issues to a rather general lack of a data-sharing culture ."
Research questions	"Lately , data journals have overcome some of these barriers ."
Research method	"In this study of more than 100 currently existing data journals , we describe the approaches they promote for data set description , availability , citation , quality , and open access ."
Research questions	We close by identifying ways to expand and strengthen the data journals approach as a means to promote data set access and exploitation .
Research questions	"Portable , web-enabled music devices are widespread , and listeners now enjoy a plethora of options regarding formats , devices , and access methods ."
Research questions	"Yet in this mobile music environment , listeners ' access and management strategies for music collections are poorly understood , because behaviors surrounding the organization and retrieval of music collections have received little formal study ."
Research questions	Our current research seeks to enrich our knowledge of people 's music listening and collecting behavior through a series of systematic user studies .
Research method	In this paper we present our Research findings/conclusions from interviews involving 20 adult and 20 teen users of commercial cloud music services .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our results contribute to theoretical understandings of users ' music information behavior in a time of upheaval in music usage patterns , and more generally , the Research questionss and meanings users ascribe to personal media collections in cloud-based systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest improvements to the future design of cloud-based music services , as well as to any information systems and services designed for personal media collections , benefiting both commercial entities and listeners ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study contributes towards better understanding of scientists ' perceptions of and priorities for data quality and data quality assurance skills needed in genome annotation .
Research method	"This study was guided by a previously developed general framework for assessment of data quality and by a taxonomy of data-quality ( DQ ) skills , and intended to define context-sensitive models of criteria for data quality and skills for genome annotation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Analysis of the results revealed that genomics scientists recognize specific sets of criteria for quality in the genome-annotation context .
Research method	"Seventeen data quality dimensions were reduced to 5-factor constructs , and 17 relevant skills were grouped into 4-factor constructs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The constructs defined by this study advance the understanding of data quality relationships and are an important contribution to data and information quality research .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the resulting models can serve as valuable resources to genome data curators and administrators for developing data-curation policies and designing DQ-assurance strategies , processes , procedures , and infrastructure ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study 's Research findings/conclusions may also inform educators in developing data quality assurance curricula and training courses .
Research method	"State-of-the-art image retrieval models are classified into three categories : content-based ( visual ) models , textual models , and combined models ."
Research method	"Content-based models use visual features to answer image queries , textual image retrieval models use word matching to answer textual queries , and combined image retrieval models , use both textual and visual features to answer queries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Nevertheless , most of previous works in this field have used the same image retrieval model independently of the query type ."
Research method	"In this article , we define a list of generic and specific medical query features and exploit them in an association rule mining technique to discover correlations between query features and image retrieval models ."
Research method	"Based on these rules , we propose to use an associative classifier ( NaiveClass ) to find the best suitable retrieval model given a new textual query ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also propose a second associative classifier ( SmartClass ) to select the most appropriate default class for the query .
Research method	Experiments are performed on Medical ImageCLEF queries from 2008 to 2012 to evaluate the impact of the proposed query features on the classification performance .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that combining our proposed specific and generic query features is effective in query classification .
Research method	"To collect data , a questionnaire , a diary study , and 2 semistructured interviews were conducted with each of 18 participants ."
Research method	Then a content analysis was used to analyze the data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the analysis of the data , this study identified 3 different types of categorizers : ( i ) rigid categorizers , ( ii ) fuzzy categorizers , and ( iii ) flexible categorizers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study provides a unique way to understand personal information categorization by showing how it reflects the mindscapes of the categorizers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In particular , this study explains why people organize their personal information differently and have different tendencies in developing and maintaining their organizational structures ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The Research findings/conclusions provide insights on different ways of categorizing personal information and deepen our knowledge of categorization , personal information management , and information behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In practice , understanding different types of personal digital information categorization can make contributions to the development of systems , tools , and applications that support effective personal digital information categorization ."
Research method	"To this end , a conceptual analysis was made by comparing key models which approach information seeking as stage-based and cyclic processes ."
Research questions	"The nature of such processes was scrutinized by devoting attention to two main aspects , that is , the temporal order in which the constituents of information seeking appear during the process , and the changes occurring in the constituents ."
Research questions	Stage-based approaches draw on linear time concept by conceptualizing such processes as sets of consecutive activities progressing toward a final point .
Research questions	Cyclic approaches conceptualize information-seeking processes as sets of iterative activities which may be repeated .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest that stage-based and cyclic approaches should not be opposite approaches ; rather , they complement each other ."
Research questions	"However , cyclic models emphasizing the importance of feedback loops have gained more popularity in the modeling of web searching , whereas the interest in the development of stage-based approaches has decreased since the 1990s ."
Research findings/conclusions	We believe that journals in which researchers from academic institutions publish their works can be considered as useful identifiers for representing the relationships between these institutions and establishing comparisons .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , when academic journals are used for research output representation , distinctions must be introduced between them , based on their value as institution descriptors ."
Research method	This leads us to the use of journal weights attached to the institution identifiers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Since a journal in which researchers from a large proportion of institutions published their papers may be a bad indicator of similarity between two academic institutions , it seems reasonable to weight it in accordance with how frequently researchers from different institutions published their papers in this journal ."
Research method	"Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the academic institutions , and dendrograms can be provided to illustrate groups of institutions following agglomerative hierarchical clustering ."
Research method	"In order to test this methodology , we use a sample of Spanish universities as a case study ."
Research method	"We first map the study sample according to an institution 's overall research output , then we use it for two scientific fields ( Information and Communication Technologies , as well as Medicine and Pharmacology ) as a means to demonstrate how our methodology can be applied , not only for analyzing institutions as a whole , but also in different disciplinary contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although sales data may give credible evidence for textbooks , these data may poorly reflect educational uses of other types of books ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As an alternative , this article proposes a method to search automatically for mentions of books in online academic course syllabi based on Bing searches for syllabi mentioning a given book , filtering out false matches through an extensive set of rules ."
Research method	"The method had an accuracy of over 90 % based on manual checks of a sample of 2,600 results from the initial Bing searches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Over one third of about 14,000 monographs checked had one or more academic syllabus mention , with more in the arts and humanities ( 56 % ) and social sciences ( 52 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Low but significant correlations between syllabus mentions and citations across most fields , except the social sciences , suggest that books tend to have different levels of impact for teaching and research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In conclusion , the automatic syllabus search method gives a new way to estimate the educational utility of books in a way that sales data and citation counts can not ."
Research findings/conclusions	One approach is to use n-grams in document representation instead of unigrams .
Research questions	"However , the majority of early works on n-grams obtained only modest performance improvement ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , the use of information based on supporting terms or contexts of queries has been found to be promising ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , recent studies showed that using new context-dependent term weights improved the performance of relevance feedback ( RF ) retrieval compared with using traditional bag-of-words BM25 term weights ."
Research method	Calculation of the new term weights requires an estimation of the local probability of relevance of each query term occurrence .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In previous studies , the estimation of this probability was based on unigrams that occur in the neighborhood of a query term ."
Research method	We explore an integration of the n-gram and context approaches by computing context-dependent term weights based on a mixture of unigrams and bigrams .
Research method	"Extensive experiments are performed using the title queries of the Text Retrieval Conference ( TREC ) -6 , TREC-7 , TREC-8 , and TREC-2005 collections , for RF with relevance judgment of either the top 10 or top 20 documents of an initial retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We identify some crucial elements needed in the use of bigrams in our methods , such as proper inverse document frequency ( IDF ) weighting of the bigrams and noise reduction by pruning bigrams with large document frequency values ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that enhancing context-dependent term weights with bigrams is effective in further improving retrieval performance .
Research questions	"The efficiency of creating new knowledge is considered to have a geographical component , that is , some regions are more capable in terms of scientific knowledge production than others ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents a method of using a network representation of scientific interaction to assess the relative efficiency of regions with diverse boundaries in channeling knowledge through a science system .
Research method	"In a first step , a weighted aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from empirical data ( aggregation ) ."
Research method	The subsequent randomization of this empirical network produces the necessary null model for significance testing and normalization ( randomization ) .
Research method	This step is repeated to provide greater confidence about the results ( re-sampling ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results are robust estimates for the relative regional efficiency of brokering knowledge , which is discussed along with cross-sectional and longitudinal empirical examples ."
Research method	The network representation acts as a straightforward metaphor of conceptual ideas from economic geography and neighboring disciplines .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the procedure is not limited to centrality measures , nor is it limited to geographical aggregates ."
Research questions	"Therefore , it offers a wide range of applications for scientometrics and beyond ."
Research method	This study compares the team size and field normalized citation impact of research across all 27 Scopus broad fields in the 10 countries with the most journal articles indexed in Scopus 2008-2012 .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that team size varies substantially by discipline and country , with Japan ( 4.2 ) having two-thirds more authors per article than the United Kingdom ( 2.5 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Solo authorship is rare in China ( 4 % ) but common in the United Kingdom ( 27 % ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"While increasing team size associates with higher citation impact in almost all countries and fields , this association is much weaker in China than elsewhere ."
Research findings/conclusions	There are also field differences in the association between citation impact and collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , larger team sizes in the Business , Management & Accounting category do not seem to associate with greater research impact , and for China and India , solo authorship associates with higher citation impact in this field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , there are substantial international and field differences in the extent to which researchers collaborate and the extent to which collaboration associates with higher citation impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The suggested index provides a benchmark for domain name traders and investors looking for information on price trends , historical returns , and the fundamental risk of Internet domain names ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The index increases transparency in the market for this newly emerged asset class .
Research findings/conclusions	Acointegration analysis shows that domain registrations and resale prices form a long-run equilibrium and indicates supply constraints in domain space .
Research method	This study explores a large data set of domain sales spanning the years 2006 to 2013 .
Research method	Differences in the quality of individual domain names are controlled for in hedonic repeat sales regressions .
Research questions	"In this article , I propose a method of searching the literature by systematically mining the various types of citation relationships between articles ."
Research method	I then test the method by comparing its precision and recall to that of 14 published systematic reviews .
Research findings/conclusions	The method successfully retrieved 74 % of the studies included in these reviews and 90 % of the studies it could reasonably be expected to retrieve .
Research findings/conclusions	The method also retrieved fewer than half of the total number of publications retrieved by these reviews and can be performed in substantially less time .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This suggests that the proposed method offers a promising complement to traditional text-based methods of literature identification and retrieval for systematic reviews .
Research method	"The method starts with a small set of seed words , representing the target category , and calculates distributional similarity between the candidate and seed words ."
Research method	"We compare 3 distributional similarity measures ( Lin 's , Weeds 's , and balAPinc ) , and a document retrieval function , BM25 , adapted as a word similarity measure ."
Research method	We then introduce a method for identifying multiword aspects by using a combination of syntactic rules and a co-occurrence association measure .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we describe a method for ranking multiword aspects by the likelihood of belonging to the target aspect category ."
Research method	The task used for evaluation is extraction of restaurant dish names from a corpus of restaurant reviews .
Research findings/conclusions	"Studying more than 15 million authors and 22 million articles from 40 countries we document that : In 2019 , almost one in three articles was ( co- ) authored by authors with multiple affiliations and the share of authors with multiple affiliations increased from around 10 % to 16 % since 1996 ."
Research findings/conclusions	The growth of multiple affiliations is prevalent in all fields and it is stronger in high impact journals .
Research findings/conclusions	About 60 % of multiple affiliations are between institutions from within the academic sector .
Research findings/conclusions	"International co-affiliations , which account for about a quarter of multiple affiliations , most often involve institutions from the United States , China , Germany and the United Kingdom , suggesting a core-periphery network ."
Research findings/conclusions	Network analysis also reveals a number communities of countries that are more likely to share affiliations .
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss potential causes and show that the timing of the rise in multiple affiliations can be linked to the introduction of more competitive funding structures such as excellence initiatives in a number of countries .
Research method	We discuss implications for science and science policy .
Research method	"We choose candidate expansion terms from a set of pseudo-relevant documents ; however , the usefulness of these terms is measured based on their definitions provided in a hand-crafted lexical resource such as WordNet ."
Research method	Experiments with a number of standard TREC collections WordNet-based that this method outperforms existing WordNet-based methods .
Research findings/conclusions	It also compares favorably with established QE methods such as KLD and RM3 .
Research method	"Leveraging earlier work in which a combination of QE methods was found to outperform each individual method ( as well as other well-known QE methods ) , we next propose a combination-based QE method that takes into account three different aspects of a candidate expansion term 's usefulness : ( a ) its distribution in the pseudo-relevant documents and in the target corpus , ( b ) its statistical association with query terms , and ( c ) its semantic relation with the query , as determined by the overlap between the WordNet definitions of the term and query terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This combination of diverse sources of information appears to work well on a number of test collections , viz. , TREC123 , TREC5 , TREC678 , TREC robust ( new ) , and TREC910 collections , and yields significant improvements over competing methods on most of these collections ."
Research method	We construct international networks based on the co-occurrences of country names in news items and trace changes in their distribution of centrality over time .
Research findings/conclusions	"Supporting previous studies , our Research findings/conclusions indicate a consistent gap between the most central and the least central countries over the years , with the United States remaining at the center of the network and African countries at its peripheries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Surprisingly , the most dynamic changes in the past 50 years occurred in what we call the middle range ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In both outlets , we identified a trend of convergence , in other words , a more equal centrality of European , Middle Eastern , and Asian countries in the news ."
Research findings/conclusions	The implications of these Research findings/conclusions are discussed .
Research method	The new method expands the initial query with a structured representation made of weighted word pairs ( WWP ) extracted from a set of training documents ( relevance feedback ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Standard text retrieval systems can handle a WWP structure through custom Boolean weighted models .
Research method	"We experimented with both the explicit and pseudorelevance feedback schemas and compared the proposed term extraction method with others in the literature , such as KLD and RM3 ."
Research method	"Evaluations have been conducted on a number of test collections ( Text REtrivel Conference [ TREC ] -6 , -7 , -8 , -9 , and -10 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results demonstrated that the QE method based on this new structure outperforms the baseline .
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , to evaluate more fully the value of blog citations , it is necessary to investigate whether research blogs focus on particular types of articles or give new perspectives on scientific discourse ."
Research questions	"Therefore , we studied the characteristics of peer-reviewed references in blogs and the typical content of blog posts to gain insight into bloggers ' motivations ."
Research method	The sample consisted of 391 blog posts from 2010 to 2012 in Researchblogging.org 's health category .
Research findings/conclusions	The bloggers mostly cited recent research articles or reviews from top multidisciplinary and general medical journals .
Research method	"Using content analysis methods , we created a general classification scheme for blog post content with 10 major topic categories , each with several subcategories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that health research bloggers rarely self-cite and that the vast majority of their blog posts ( 90 % ) include a general discussion of the issue covered in the article , with more than one quarter providing health-related advice based on the article ( s ) covered ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These factors suggest a genuine attempt to engage with a wider , nonacademic audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , almost 30 % of the posts included some criticism of the issues being discussed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Having to adhere to requirements of platforms such as Twitter , researchers can only release a list of unique identifiers , which others can then use to recollect the data themselves ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This leads to subsets of the data no longer being available , as content can be deleted or user accounts deactivated ."
Research method	"To quantify the long-term impact of this in the replicability of datasets , we perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of 30 Twitter datasets , which include more than 147 million tweets ."
Research method	"By recollecting Twitter datasets ranging from 0 to 4 years old by using the tweet IDs , we look at four different factors quantifying the extent to which recollected datasets resemble original ones : completeness , representativity , similarity , and changingness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the ratio of available tweets keeps decreasing as the dataset gets older , we find that the textual content of the recollected subset is still largely representative of the original dataset ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The representativity of the metadata , however , keeps fading over time , both because the dataset shrinks and because certain metadata , such as the users ' number of followers , keeps changing ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our study has important implications for researchers sharing and using publicly shared Twitter datasets in their research .
Research questions	"We do so by tracking entities that emerge in public discourse , that is , in online text streams such as social media and news streams , before they are incorporated into Wikipedia , which , we argue , can be viewed as an online place for collective memory ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By tracking how entities emerge in public discourse , that is , the temporal patterns between their first mention in online text streams and subsequent incorporation into collective memory , we gain insights into how the collective remembrance process happens online ."
Research method	"Specifically , we analyze nearly 80,000 entities as they emerge in online text streams before they are incorporated into Wikipedia ."
Research method	"The online text streams we use for our analysis comprise of social media and news streams , and span over 579 million documents in a time span of 18 months ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discover two main emergence patterns : entities that emerge in a bursty fashion , that is , that appear in public discourse without a precedent , blast into activity and transition into collective memory ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Other entities display a delayed pattern , where they appear in public discourse , experience a period of inactivity , and then resurface before transitioning into our cultural collective memory ."
Research questions	"However , such data present challenges for both human and computational methods , requiring a diverse range of specialist skills , often shared across a number of individuals ."
Research method	"In this paper we use the analysis of a real-world data set as our case study , and use this exploration as a demonstration of our insight workflow , which we present for use and adaptation by other researchers ."
Research method	"The data we use are impact case study documents collected as part of the UK Research Excellence Framework ( REF ) , consisting of 6,679 documents and 6.25 million words ; the analysis was commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England ( published as report HEFCE 2015 ) ."
Research method	"In our exploration and analysis we used a variety of techniques , ranging from keyword in context and frequency information to more sophisticated methods ( topic modeling ) , with these automated techniques providing an empirical point of entry for in-depth and intensive human analysis ."
Research method	"We present the 60 topics to demonstrate the output of our methods , and illustrate how the variety of analysis techniques can be combined to provide insights ."
Research findings/conclusions	We note potential limitations and propose future work .
Research questions	It poses significant threats to organizational operations and information security .
Research findings/conclusions	"This article reviews insider threat research and outlines key propositions to conceptualize the interpretation of dynamic human information behavior in an organizational setting , which represent an integration of trustworthiness and human sensors ' attribution in close relationships ."
Research questions	"These propositions posit that when a focal individual violates integrity-based trust , the group can collectively attribute a shift in trustworthiness , triggering a natural peer attribution process that assigns cause to observed behavior ."
Research questions	Group communication can thus reflect subtle changes in a focal individual 's perceived trustworthiness .
Research questions	The ability to understand group-based computer-mediated communication patterns over time may become essential in safeguarding information assets and the digital well-being of today 's organizations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article contributes a novel theoretical lens to examine dynamic insights on insider threat detection .
Research questions	"Although differences in determining trustworthiness and authority of scholarly resources exist among age groups and fields of study , traditional methods and criteria remain important across the board ."
Research findings/conclusions	Peer review is considered the most important factor for determining the quality and trustworthiness of research .
Research findings/conclusions	"Researchers continue to read abstracts , check content for sound arguments and credible data , and rely on journal rankings when deciding whether to trust scholarly resources in reading , citing , or publishing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Social media outlets and open access publications are still often not trusted , although many researchers believe that open access has positive implications for research , especially if the open access journals are peer reviewed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Being able to provide a reason why items are similar has applications in recommendation , personalization , and search ."
Research method	"We investigate the problem within the context of Europeana , a large digital library containing items related to cultural heritage ."
Research findings/conclusions	A range of types of similarity in this collection were identified .
Research method	"A set of 1,500 pairs of items from the collection were annotated using crowdsourcing ."
Research findings/conclusions	A high intertagger agreement ( average 71.5 Pearson correlation ) was obtained and demonstrates that the task is well defined .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We also present several approaches to automatically identifying the type of similarity .
Research method	"The best system applies linear regression and achieves a mean Pearson correlation of 71.3 , close to human performance ."
Research method	"The problem formulation and data set described here were used in a public evaluation exercise , the * SEM shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity ."
Research method	"The task attracted the participation of 6 teams , who submitted 14 system runs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"All annotations , evaluation scripts , and system runs are freely available ."
Research method	-1
Research method	This intersection is described by a summary of conceptualizations of research synthesis in a diverse set of research fields and in the context of Swanson 's ( 1986 ) discussion of undiscovered public knowledge .
Research method	"Through a selective literature review , research topics that intersect with LIS and RSM are outlined ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Topics identified include open access , information retrieval , bias and research information ethics , referencing practices , citation patterns , and data science ."
Research method	"Subsequently , bibliometrics and topic modeling are used to present a systematic overview of the visibility of RSM in LIS ."
Research findings/conclusions	This analysis indicates that RSM became visible in LIS in the 1980s .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , LIS research has drawn substantially from general and internal medicine , the field 's own literature , and business ; and is drawn on by health and medical sciences , computing , and business ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Through this analytical overview , it is confirmed that research synthesis is more visible in the health and medical literature in LIS ; but suggests that , LIS , as a meta-science , has the potential to make substantive contributions to a broader variety of fields in the context of topics related to research synthesis methods ."
Research method	"We analyze a dataset of 150 long essays whose authors searched the ClueWeb09 corpus for source material , while all querying , clicking , and writing activity was meticulously recorded ."
Research method	We model the effect of search and writing behavior on essay quality using path analysis .
Research method	"Since the boil-down and build-up writing strategies identified in previous research have been found to affect search behavior , we model each writing strategy separately ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis shows that the search process contributes significantly to essay quality through both direct and mediated effects , while the author 's writing strategy moderates this relationship ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our models explain 25-35 % of the variation in essay quality through rather simple search and writing process characteristics alone , a fact that has implications on how search engines could personalize result pages for writing tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Authors ' writing strategies and associated searching patterns differ , producing differences in essay quality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In a nutshell : essay quality improves if search and writing strategies harmonize-build-up writers benefit from focused , in-depth querying , while boil-down writers fare better with a broader and shallower querying strategy ."
Research questions	"With the popularity of crowdsourcing , different types of HCGs have been developed using various gameplay mechanics to attract online users to contribute outputs ."
Research method	Two commonly used mechanics are collaboration and competition .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Yet there is little research examining whether HCGs perform better than nongame applications in terms of motivations and perceptions .
Research questions	"Thus , this study investigates the effects of collaborative and competitive mechanics on intrinsic motivation and perceived output quality in mobile content sharing HCGs ."
Research method	"Using a within-subjects experiment , 160 participants were recruited from 2 local universities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest that the nongame application was perceived to yield better quality output than both HCGs , but the latter offered a greater satisfaction of motivational needs , which may motivate individuals to continue playing them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Taken together , the present Research findings/conclusions inform researchers and designers of HCGs that games could serve as a motivator to encourage participation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the usefulness of HCGs may be dependent on how one can effectively manage the entertainment-output generation duality of such games ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This article concludes by presenting implications , limitations , and future research directions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research contributes to the discussion on solving digital exclusion issues by addressing the emergent roles and challenges of Lithuanian public libraries in reducing the digital divide .
Research method	The article combines a multilevel model of the digital divide with the concept of business idea and analyzes the future scenarios of Lithuanian public libraries .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions highlight the public libraries ' importance in conducting training , consultancy , and experiential learning to stimulate digital inclusion ."
Research questions	"Potentially , libraries can motivate users to adopt digital technologies , but this role is still not sufficiently visible ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions show that libraries face challenges of redefining their social value and obtaining the sustaining funds , skills , and infrastructure necessary for digital inclusion programs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , they can use collaboration networks , effective cost management , and external expertise to overcome these obstacles ."
Research questions	"These state-of-the-art strategies are highly dependent on linguistic features that best suit the language for which they were intended , constraining their adaptability and making it difficult to determine whether they would remain effective if they were applied to estimate the level of difficulty of texts in other languages ."
Research questions	"In this article , we present the results of a study designed to determine the feasibility of a cross-lingual readability assessment strategy ."
Research method	"For doing so , we first analyzed the most common features used for readability assessment and determined their influence on the readability prediction process of 6 different languages : English , Spanish , Basque , Italian , French , and Catalan ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , we developed a cross-lingual readability assessment strategy that serves as a means to empirically explore the potential advantages of employing a single strategy ( and set of features ) for readability assessment in different languages , including interlanguage prediction agreement and prediction accuracy improvement for low-resource languages ."
Research questions	"In such research , opinions about politicians are typically divided into positive , negative , or neutral ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In our research , the goal is to mine political opinion from social media at a higher resolution by assessing statements of opinion related to the personality traits of politicians ; this is an angle that has not yet been considered in social media research ."
Research questions	A second goal is to contribute a novel retrieval-based approach for tracking public perception of personality using Gough and Heilbrun 's Adjective Check List ( ACL ) of 110 terms describing key traits .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This is in contrast to the typical lexical and machine-learning approaches used in sentiment analysis .
Research method	High-precision search templates developed from the ACL were run on an 18-month span of Twitter posts mentioning Obama and Romney and these retrieved more than half a million tweets .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , the results indicated that Romney was perceived as more of an achiever and Obama was perceived as somewhat more friendly ."
Research method	The traits were also aggregated into 14 broad personality dimensions .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , Obama rated far higher than Romney on the Moderation dimension and lower on the Machiavellianism dimension ."
Research questions	The temporal variability of such perceptions was explored .
Research questions	"To better understand the intellectual heritage and major influences shaping the development of the individual and collective identities in iSchools , we develop a classification of the intellectual domains of iSchool faculty education ."
Research method	We use this to develop a descriptive analysis of the community 's intellectual composition .
Research questions	The discussion focuses on characterizing intellectual diversity in the iSchools .
Research questions	We conclude with a discussion of the potential implications of these trends relative to the future development of the iSchool community .
Research method	"Because the data are freely available for downloading and include the names of the researchers ' institutions , we produced a ranking of the institutions on the basis of the number of highly cited researchers per institution ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This ranking is intended to be a helpful amendment of other available institutional rankings .
Research questions	"In addition to authoritative health information sites maintained by government health departments and healthcare institutions , there are many social media sites carrying user-contributed information ."
Research questions	This study sought to identify the types of drug information available on consumer-contributed drug review sites when compared with authoritative drug information websites .
Research method	"Content analysis was performed on the information available for nine drugs on three authoritative sites ( RxList , eMC , and PDRhealth ) as well as three drug review sites ( WebMD , RateADrug , and PatientsLikeMe ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The types of information found on authoritative sites but rarely on drug review sites include pharmacology , special population considerations , contraindications , and drug interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Types of information found only on drug review sites include drug efficacy , drug resistance experienced by long-term users , cost of drug in relation to insurance coverage , availability of generic forms , comparison with other similar drugs and with other versions of the drug , difficulty in using the drug , and advice on coping with side effects ."
Research findings/conclusions	Drug efficacy ratings by users were found to be different across the three sites .
Research findings/conclusions	"Side effects were vividly described in context , with user assessment of severity based on discomfort and effect on their lives ."
Research questions	"In this article , we investigate how providing different kinds of awareness support affects people 's coordination behavior in a CIS task , as reflected by the communication that took place between them ."
Research method	We describe a laboratory study with 84 participants in 42 pairs with an experimental CIS system .
Research method	These participants were brought to the laboratory for two separate sessions and given two exploratory search tasks .
Research method	"They were randomly assigned to one of the three systems , defined by the kind of awareness support provided ."
Research method	We analyzed the messages exchanged between the participants of each team by coding them for their coordination attributes .
Research findings/conclusions	"With this coding , we show how the participants employed different kinds of coordination during the study ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using qualitative and quantitative analyses , we demonstrate that the teams with no awareness , or with only personal awareness support , needed to spend more time and effort doing coordination than those with proper group awareness support ."
Research findings/conclusions	We argue that appropriate and adequate awareness support is essential for a CIS system for reducing coordination costs and keeping the collaborators well coordinated for a productive collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions have implications for system designers as well as cognitive scientists and CIS researchers in general .
Research findings/conclusions	"Examples include visual analytics , decision support , and educational tools ."
Research questions	"Through interaction with visual representations of information at the visual interface of these tools , a joint , coordinated cognitive system is formed ."
Research findings/conclusions	This partnership results in a number of relational properties-those depending on both humans and tools-that researchers and designers must be aware of if such tools are to effectively support the performance of complex cognitive activities .
Research findings/conclusions	This article presents 10 properties of interactive visual representations that are essential and relational and whose values can be adjusted through interaction .
Research findings/conclusions	"By adjusting the values of these properties , better coordination between humans and tools can be effected , leading to higher quality performance of complex cognitive activities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article examines how the values of these properties affect cognitive processing and visual reasoning and demonstrates the necessity of making their values adjustable-all of which is situated within a broader theoretical framework concerned with human-information interaction in complex cognitive activities .
Research findings/conclusions	"This framework can facilitate systematic research , design , and evaluation in numerous fields including information visualization , health informatics , visual analytics , and educational technology ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With secondary data from a 2012 survey ( N=622 ) , the final well-fitting structural equation model revealed that teen online privacy concerns were primarily influenced by parental interpersonal trust and parental concerns about teens ' online privacy , whereas teen privacy protection behaviors were primarily predicted by teen cost-benefit appraisal of online interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In turn , teen online privacy concerns predicted increased privacy protection behaviors and lower teen information disclosure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , restrictive and instructive parental mediation exerted differential influences on teens ' privacy protection behaviors and online information disclosure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Unfortunately , the majority of published books are assigned a readability level range , which is not useful to readers who look for books at a particular grade level ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Existing readability formulas/analysis tools require at least an excerpt of a book to estimate its readability level , which is a severe constraint , since copyright laws prohibit book contents from being made publicly accessible ."
Research method	"To alleviate the constraint , we have developed TRoLL which relies on publicly accessible online book metadata , in addition to using a book 's snippet , if it is available , to predict its readability level ."
Research method	"Based on a multi-dimensional regression analysis , TRoLL determines the grade level of any book instantly , even without a sample of its text , and considers its topical suitability , which is unique ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , TRoLL is a significant contribution to the educational community , since its computed book readability levels can enrich K-12 readers ' book selections and aid parents , teachers , and librarians in locating reading materials suitable for their K-12 readers , which can be a time-consuming and frustrating task that does not always yield a quality outcome ."
Research method	Conducted empirical studies have verified the prediction accuracy of TRoLL and demonstrated its superiority over well-known readability formulas/analysis tools .
Research method	"In the Gmail study , we informed 75 participants about both folder-labeling and tag-labeling , observed their storage behavior after 1 month , and asked them to estimate the proportions of different retrieval options in their behavior ."
Research method	"In the Windows 7 study , we informed 23 participants about tags and asked them to tag all their files for 2 weeks , followed by a period of 5 weeks of free choice between the 2 methods ."
Research method	"Their storage and retrieval habits were tested prior to the learning session and , after 7 weeks , using special classification recording software and a retrieval-habits questionnaire ."
Research method	A controlled retrieval task and an in-depth interview were conducted .
Research findings/conclusions	Results of both studies show a strong preference for folders over tags for both storage and retrieval .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the minority of cases where tags were used for storage , participants typically used a single tag per information item ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , when multiple classification was used for storage , it was only marginally used for retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	The controlled retrieval task showed lower success rates and slower retrieval speeds for tag use .
Research findings/conclusions	Possible reasons for participants ' preferences are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	The differences between them are only the features selected and the method used for weighting them .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we present an unsupervised method for polarity classification in Twitter ."
Research method	The method is based on the expansion of the concepts expressed in the tweets through the application of PageRank to WordNet .
Research method	"In addition , we integrate SentiWordNet to compute the final value of polarity ."
Research method	The synsets values are weighted with the PageRank scores obtained in the previous random walk process over WordNet .
Research findings/conclusions	The results obtained show that disambiguation and expansion are good strategies for improving overall performance .
Research findings/conclusions	Here I advocate and demonstrate adaption of the h-index and the g-index to the top video content creators on YouTube .
Research method	The h-index for Internet video media is based on videos and their view counts .
Research method	The h-index is defined as the number of videos with > = h x 10 ( 5 ) views .
Research method	The g-index is defined as the number of videos with > = g x 10 ( 5 ) views on average .
Research findings/conclusions	"When compared with a video creator 's total view count , the h-index and g-index better capture both productivity and impact in a single metric ."
Research questions	"One area where consumers are particularly prone to make costly decision-making errors is long-term saving , which requires understanding of complex concepts such as uncertainty and trade-offs ."
Research questions	"Although most people are poorly equipped to deal with such concepts , interactive design can potentially help users make better decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	We developed an interactive information label to assist consumers with retirement saving decision-making .
Research method	"To evaluate it , we exposed 450 users to one of four user interface conditions in a retirement saving simulator where they made 35 yearly decisions under changing circumstances ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found a significantly better ability of users to reach their goals with the information label .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , users who interacted with the label made better decisions than those who were presented with a static information label ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Lastly , we found the label particularly effective in helping novice savers ."
Research method	"Through a qualitative content analysis of 200 posts across Internet groups , we identify topics and information needs expressed by people who feel they have no other sources of support available to them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We uncover various health , well-being , social , and identity issues that are not only crucial to the lives of the people posting but which they are unwilling to risk revealing elsewhere-offering evidence that these online environments provide an outlet for the expression of critical and hidden information needs ."
Research method	"To enable this analysis , we first describe our method for reliably identifying situations of information poverty in messages posted to these groups and outline our coding approach ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our work contributes to the study of both information seeking within the context of information poverty and the use of Internet groups as sources of information and support , bridging the two by exploring the manifestation of information poverty in this particular online setting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , the numbers of inlinks to academic websites are associated with academic performance , while the counts of inlinks to company websites correlate with business variables ."
Research questions	"However , the scarcity of sources from which to collect inlink data in recent years has required us to seek new data sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	The recent demise of the inlink search function of Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	made this need more pressing .
Research findings/conclusions	Different alternative variables or data sources have been proposed .
Research method	"This study compared three types of web data to determine which are better as academic and business quality estimates , and what are the relationships among the three data sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study found that Alexa inlink and Google URL citation data can replace Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	inlink data and that the former is better than the latter .
Research findings/conclusions	"Alexa is even better than Yahoo ! , which has been the main data source in recent years ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The unique nature of Alexa data could explain its relative advantages over other data sources .
Research method	"Using a coding scheme developed through qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews , these data can be subjected to exploratory statistical analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The reasons given by respondents for getting the ICD differed by both region and gender , and show some correlations with whether the device has or has not delivered any stimulation ( shocks ) since implantation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Cluster analysis reveals association among certain important themes in the discussion of the decision process , particularly linking rather opposite concepts into clusters related to specific dimensions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest the importance , to patients , of maintaining the integrity of the self by asserting control and independence ."
Research findings/conclusions	The majority of the respondents ( 61 % ) have not received the primary intended benefit of the device ( stimulation ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , the Research findings/conclusions suggest that psychological benefits alone of having the device ( such as anxiety reduction ) serve to justify acceptance of a computerized device ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for other lines of computerized health support and for further study of these issues are discussed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	In this work we attempt to help users browsing a large number of accumulated posts .
Research findings/conclusions	We propose a personalized word cloud generation as a means for users ' navigation .
Research method	"Various user past activities such as user published tweets , retweets , and seen but not retweeted tweets are leveraged for enhanced personalization of word clouds ."
Research findings/conclusions	The best personalization results are attained with user past retweets .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , users ' own past tweets are not as useful as retweets for personalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	Negative preferences derived from seen but not retweeted tweets further enhance personalized word cloud generation .
Research findings/conclusions	The ranking combination method outperforms the preranking approach and provides a general framework for combined ranking of various user past information for enhanced word cloud generation .
Research method	"To better capture subtle differences of generated word clouds , we propose an evaluation of word clouds with a mean average precision measure ."
Research questions	"This study aimed to unpack how young people ( middle and high schoolers ) sought , used , and shared information in voluntary free-choice library makerspace activities ."
Research method	"Qualitative methods , including individual interviews , observations , photovoice , and focus groups , were used to elicit 21 participants ' experiences at two library makerspaces ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions showed that young people engaged in dynamic practices of information seeking , use , and sharing , and revealed how the historical , sociocultural , material , and technological contexts embedded in makerspace activities shaped these information practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Information practices of tinkering , sensing , and imagining in makerspaces were highlighted ."
Research findings/conclusions	Various criteria that young people used in evaluating human sources and online information were identified as well .
Research findings/conclusions	The study also demonstrated the communicative and collaborative aspects of young people 's information practices through information sharing .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The Research findings/conclusions extended Savolainen 's everyday information practices model and addressed the gap in the current literature on young people 's information behavior and information practices .
Research findings/conclusions	Understanding how young people interact with information in makerspaces can help makerspace facilitators and information professionals better support youth services and facilitate makerspace activities .
Research questions	The increasing practice of interdisciplinary research challenges the effectiveness of journal-based assessments .
Research questions	The aim of this article is to highlight topics as a valuable unit of analysis .
Research method	A set of topic-based approaches is applied to a data set on library and information science publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that topic-based approaches are capable of revealing the research dynamics , impact , and dissemination of the selected data set ."
Research findings/conclusions	The article also identifies a nonsignificant relationship between topic popularity and impact and argues for the need to use both variables in describing topic characteristics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , a flow map illustrates critical topic-level knowledge dissemination channels ."
Research findings/conclusions	Science publications written in other languages do not gain the same exposure to the international scientific community as does the material in English .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this sense , non-English articles constitute an invisible science for the rest of the scientific world ."
Research method	"This study compares publications indexed in the academic-oriented Hebrew Index of Periodicals ( IHP ) database with those in the Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCIE ) in order to document the amount of scientific material published in Israel , where Hebrew is the native language ."
Research questions	"Except for abstracts , which are sometimes given in English , as well as Hebrew , and therefore provide some idea of a paper 's content , most of this research remains hidden from the international scientific community ."
Research method	"The SCIE and IHP databases for our examination cover the three grand disciplines : the exact and life sciences , the social sciences , and the humanities ."
Research questions	"Additionally , the study probes the coverage of medical publications in the two databases ."
Research questions	The difference between old and emerging disciplines in the use of a language other than Hebrew is observed and non-English citation patterns for various disciplines are examined .
Research findings/conclusions	The results confirm the dominance of English as the lingua franca of science and point to the large number of scientific studies in Hebrew that lack international exposure .
Research method	"This article describes the application of analysis methods from two distinct fields , one method from interpretive social science and one method from statistical machine learning , to the same survey data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the two analyses produce some similar and some complementary insights about the phenomenon of interest , in this case , nonuse of social media ."
Research method	"We compare both the processes of conducting these analyses and the results they produce to derive insights about each method 's unique advantages and drawbacks , as well as the broader roles that these methods play in the respective fields where they are often used ."
Research findings/conclusions	These insights allow us to make more informed decisions about the tradeoffs in choosing different methods for analyzing textual data .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , this comparison suggests ways that such methods might be combined in novel and compelling ways ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An online discussion forum ( ODF ) is one of these mechanisms , but it will only be successful if students are willing to participate ."
Research questions	Stimulating students is a challenge many institutions currently face .
Research questions	The objective of this study was to analyze the social interaction among participants in ODFs using Social Network Analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	Knowing the characteristics of these networks and its participants is important to design actions to improve the use of ODFs .
Research method	"As a case study , data were collected from ODF logs of the majors in Business Administration and Accounting in a Brazilian private university ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study found out that these interaction networks are sparse , which shows that students could be more engaged in interacting and collaborating with others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Students , in general , tend to interact more in the first semester and interaction diminishes as time passes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The number of active ODF participants has been around 45-50 % , which shows that students currently do not participate very often in ODFs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Their main incentive seems to exist when they are graded .
Research method	Popular ODFs were also analyzed .
Research method	This article expands on the data sharing component of a paper presented at the 2013 ASIST conference .
Research method	A three-phase project is reported .
Research method	"Conducted between 2011 and 2013 within an environmental voluntary group , the Australian Plants Society Victoria ( APSV ) , the interviews of the first phase are the major data source ."
Research method	"Because the project revealed the importance of data sharing with professional scientists , their views are included in the literature review where four themes are explored : lack of shared disciplinary culture , trust , responsibility and controlled access to data , and describing data to enable reuse ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions , presented under these themes , revealed that , within APSV , sharing among members is mostly generous and uninhibited ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Beyond APSV , when online repositories were involved , barriers came very strongly into play ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Trust was weaker and barriers also included issues of data quality , data description , and ownership and control ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The conclusion is that further investigation of these barriers , including the attitudes of professional scientists to using data contributed by citizen scientists , would indicate how more extensive and useful data sharing could be achieved ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we identify spatial patterns of collaboration in Brazil and measure the role of geographic proximity in determining the interaction among researchers ."
Research method	"Using a database comprising more than one million researchers and seven million publications , we consolidated information on interregional research collaboration in terms of scientific coauthorship networks among 4,615 municipalities during the period between 1992 and 2009 , which allowed us to analyze a range of data unprecedented in the literature ."
Research method	The effects of geographic distance on collaboration were measured for different areas by estimating spatial interaction models .
Research findings/conclusions	"The main results provide strong evidence of geographic deconcentration of collaboration in recent years , with increased participation of authors in scientifically less traditional regions , such as south and northeast Brazil ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Distance remains a significant factor in determining the intensity of knowledge flow in collaboration networks in Brazil , as an increase of 100km between two researchers reduces the probability of collaboration by an average of 16 % , and there is no evidence that the effect of distance has diminished over time , although the magnitude of such effects varies among networks of different areas ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It has been pointed out that very little is known about the psychosocial variables that predict people 's use of these websites .
Research questions	"In this article , our general objective is to understand behavioral intentions to use SNS employing the well-known unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ( UTAUT ) , which has been validated in a number of studies ."
Research method	"Data were collected through a questionnaire survey from a final sample of 1,039 social networking website users in Africa ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We have shown that there are contexts , such as the African context , in which the UTAUT does not hold up ."
Research findings/conclusions	Explanations are provided to support the Research findings/conclusions .
Research method	Kuhlthau 's 7-stage Information Search Process ( ISP ) model forms the conceptual framework for the study .
Research questions	"The aim of the study was to define an end game for the ISP model by answering the following question : How do the student participants ' feelings , thoughts , and information behavior lead to the construction of new knowledge ?"
Research findings/conclusions	"Study Research findings/conclusions tentatively indicate that knowledge construction results from an iterative process between the student and information , which can be divided into 3 phases ."
Research method	"In the first phase , the students formulate questions from their previous knowledge to start knowledge construction ; in the second phase , newly found topic information causes students to ask questions ; and in the third phase , the students answer the questions asked by this newly found topic information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these results and Kuhlthau 's own ISP stage 7 assessment definition of the ISP model end game , we propose a model of knowledge construction inserted as an extra row in the ISP model framework ."
Research questions	"Online fake news is a specific type of digital misinformation that poses serious threats to democratic institutions , misguides the public , and can lead to radicalization and violence ."
Research questions	"Hence , fake news detection is an important problem for information science research ."
Research questions	"While there have been multiple attempts to identify fake news , most of such efforts have focused on a single modality ( e.g. , only text-based or only visual features ) ."
Research questions	"However , news articles are increasingly framed as multimodal news stories , and hence , in this work , we propose a multimodal approach combining text and visual analysis of online news stories to automatically detect fake news ."
Research method	"Drawing on key theories of information processing and presentation , we identify multiple text and visual features that are associated with fake or credible news articles ."
Research method	We then perform a predictive analysis to detect features most strongly associated with fake news .
Research method	"Next , we combine these features in predictive models using multiple machine-learning techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results indicate that a multimodal approach outperforms single-modality approaches , allowing for better fake news detection ."
Research method	"The authors considered this problem by examining the domains , objectives , and architectures of nine metadata schemes used to document scientific data in the physical , life , and social sciences ."
Research method	"They used a mixed-methods content analysis and Greenberg 's ( ) metadata objectives , principles , domains , and architectural layout ( MODAL ) framework , and derived 22 metadata-related goals from textual content describing each metadata scheme ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Relationships are identified between the domains ( e.g. , scientific discipline and type of data ) and the categories of scheme objectives ."
Research method	"For each strong correlation ( > 0.6 ) , a Fisher 's exact test for nonparametric data was used to determine significance ( p ? < ? .05 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Significant relationships were found between the domains and objectives of the schemes .
Research findings/conclusions	Schemes describing observational data are more likely to have scheme harmonization ( compatibility and interoperability with related schemes ) as an objective ; schemes with the objective abstraction ( a conceptual model exists separate from the technical implementation ) also have the objective sufficiency ( the scheme defines a minimal amount of information to meet the needs of the community ) ; and schemes with the objective data publication do not have the objective element refinement .
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis indicates that many metadata-driven goals expressed by communities are independent of scientific discipline or the type of data , although they are constrained by historical community practices and workflows as well as the technological environment at the time of scheme creation ."
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis reveals 11 fundamental metadata goals for metadata documenting scientific data in support of sharing research data across disciplines and domains .
Research findings/conclusions	"The authors report these results and highlight the need for more metadata-related research , particularly in the context of recent funding agency policy changes ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Existing research mainly focuses on the ways in which SNSs are used in libraries and on librarians ' or users ' attitudes towards these SNSs .
Research method	"This study focused on the flow of information via SNS interactions between librarians and users on library Facebook , Twitter , and Chinese Weibo sites , and developed an SNS user interaction type model based on these information flows ."
Research method	"A mixed-method approach was employed combining quantitative data generated from the analysis of 1,753 posts sampled from 40 library SNSs and qualitative data from interviews with 10 librarians ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Four types of interactions were identified : information/knowledge sharing , information dissemination , communication , and information gathering ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study found that SNSs were used primarily as channels for disseminating news and announcements about things currently happening in the library .
Research findings/conclusions	Communication allowed open-ended questions and produced more replies .
Research findings/conclusions	"In Facebook posts , Chinese Facebook users generated less likes than English-speaking users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The comparison of data between Facebook-like and Twitter-like SNSs in different library settings suggested that libraries need to coordinate different types of SNSs , and take library settings and sociocultural environments into consideration in order to enhance and encourage user engagement and interaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Bibliometric and patent file searches indicate that the Syntex industrial laboratory located in Mexico and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico ( UNAM ) produced about 54 % of the relevant papers published in mainstream journals , which in turn generated over 80 % of the citations and in the case of Syntex , all industrial patents in the field between 1950 and 1965 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This course of events , which was unprecedented at that time in a developing country , was interrupted when Syntex moved its research division to the US , leaving Mexico with a small but productive research group in the chemistry of natural products ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These training sets are costly and laborious to produce , requiring human annotators to assess the relevance or order of the documents in relation to a query ."
Research findings/conclusions	Active learning algorithms are able to reduce the labeling effort by selectively sampling an unlabeled set and choosing data instances that maximize a learning function 's effectiveness .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we propose a novel two-stage active learning method for L2R that combines and exploits interesting properties of its constituent parts , thus being effective and practical ."
Research method	"In the first stage , an association rule active sampling algorithm is used to select a very small but effective initial training set ."
Research method	"In the second stage , a query-by-committee strategy trained with the first-stage set is used to iteratively select more examples until a preset labeling budget is met or a target effectiveness is achieved ."
Research method	We test our method with various LETOR benchmarking data sets and compare it with several baselines to show that it achieves good results using only a small portion of the original training sets .
Research method	"In this article , through an observational user study , we investigate the search behavior of 15 visually impaired and 15 sighted searchers while they complete complex search tasks online ."
Research questions	"We study complex search tasks because they are challenging , cognitively intensive and affect performance of searchers ."
Research method	"We compare the behavior of the two groups of searchers at four stages of the information-seeking process namely , Query Formulation , Search Results Exploration , Query Reformulation , and Search Results Management ."
Research method	"For each stage , we identify research questions to investigate the impact of speech-based screen readers on the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users ."
Research findings/conclusions	Significant differences were observed during query formulation and in the use of query-level support features such as query suggestions and spelling suggestions .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , screen-reader users submitted a lower number of queries and displayed comparatively limited exploratory behavior during search results exploration ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We investigate how a lack of visual cues affected visually impaired searchers ' approach towards query reformulation and observed different strategies to manage and use information encountered during the search process .
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss the implications that our Research findings/conclusions have for the design of search interfaces and propose a set of design guidelines to consider when designing interfaces that are usable and accessible with screen readers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work also enhances our understanding of search behavior when using an auditory interface and could be useful when designing audio-based information retrieval systems .
Research method	"A questionnaire was administered to 1,048 students in the 7th to 11th grades in six different schools , one class in each grade ."
Research method	"The questionnaire included personal data , characteristics of Internet interaction patterns , moral dilemmas in daily life , and moral dilemmas in the virtual environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"No significant differences were found between the genders regarding the age usage of the Internet began , Internet experience , and average daily hours of Internet use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that boys prefer , more than girls , to surf at school and in Internet cafes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Girls tend to use the Internet more for doing homework and blogs than boys , whereas boys tend to play Internet games more than girls ."
Research findings/conclusions	Gender differences were found regarding immoral behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"Boys were involved more frequently than girls in behaviors such as cyberbullying , plagiarism , impersonation , and downloading music and movies illegally from the Internet ."
Research findings/conclusions	A correlation was found between gender and moral judgment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although both boys and girls made relatively little humane judgment in the Internet environment , girls tended to make humane judgment more frequently than boys ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the Internet environment , boys tended to make absence of judgment evaluations more than girls ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Girls tended , relatively more , toward normative judgment that reflects adherence to peer-group conventions with minimal reflexivity ."
Research questions	"Distributed individuals independently edit , revise , or refine content , thereby creating knowledge artifacts of considerable breadth and quality ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our study explores the mechanisms that control and guide the content creation process and develops an understanding of open content governance .
Research method	The repertory grid method is employed to systematically capture the experiences of individuals involved in the open content creation process and to determine the relative importance of the diverse control and guiding mechanisms .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions illustrate the important control and guiding mechanisms and highlight the multifaceted nature of open content governance .
Research questions	"A range of governance mechanisms is discussed with regard to the varied levels of formality , the different loci of authority , and the diverse interaction environments involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	Limitations and opportunities for future research are provided .
Research findings/conclusions	"The sole protection for any user are three sets of privacy protections afforded by Facebook : settings that control information privacy ( i.e. , security of social media accounts and identity information ) , accessibility privacy or anonymity ( i.e. , manage who can connect with a user ) , and those that control expressive privacy ( i.e. , control who can see a user 's posts and tag you ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using these settings , however , involves a trade-off between making oneself accessible and thereby vulnerable to potential attacks , or enacting stringent protections that could potentially make someone inaccessible thereby reducing the benefits that are accruable through social media ."
Research method	"Using two theoretical frameworks , Uses and Gratifications ( U & G ) and Protection Motivation Theory ( PMT ) , the research examined how individuals congitvely juxtaposed the cost of maintaining privacy through the use of these settings against the benefits of openness ."
Research findings/conclusions	The application of the U & G framework revealed that social need fulfillment was the single most significant benefit driving privacy management .
Research findings/conclusions	"From the cost standpoint , the PMT framework pointed to perceived severity impacting expressive and information privacy , and perceived susceptability influencing accessibility privacy ."
Research questions	"CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption , pollution , and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities ."
Research questions	"However , beyond anecdotal evidence , there is a dearth of understanding why people participate in CC ."
Research questions	"Therefore , in this article we investigate people 's motivations to participate in CC ."
Research method	The study employs survey data ( N=168 ) gathered from people registered onto a CC site .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability , enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains ."
Research findings/conclusions	An interesting detail in the result is that sustainability is not directly associated with participation unless it is at the same time also associated with positive attitudes towards CC .
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests that sustainability might only be an important factor for those people for whom ecological consumption is important .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the results suggest that in CC an attitude-behavior gap might exist ; people perceive the activity positively and say good things about it , but this good attitude does not necessary translate into action ."
Research questions	Social support is crucial to the well-being and quality of life of people with unpredictable and incurable diseases such as ALS .
Research questions	Members of the PatientsLikeMe ( PLM ) ALS online support community share social support but also exchange and build distributed knowledge within their discussion forum .
Research method	"This qualitative analysis of 1,000 posts from the PLM ALS online discussion examines the social support within the PLM ALS online community and explores ways community members share and build knowledge ."
Research method	The analysis responds to 3 research questions : RQ1 : How and why is knowledge shared among the distributed participants in the PLM-ALS threaded discussion forum ?
Research questions	; RQ2 : How do the participants in the PLM-ALS threaded discussion forum work together to discover knowledge about treatments and to keep knowledge discovered over time ?
Research questions	"; and RQ3 : How do participants in the PLM-ALS forum co-create and treat authoritative knowledge from multiple sources including the medical literature , healthcare professionals , lived experiences of patients and other sources of information such as lay literature and alternative health providers ?"
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions have implications for supporting knowledge sharing and discovery in addition to social support for patients .
Research questions	"Being a new form of work facilitated by information technology , the rise of crowdsourcing calls for the development of new theoretical insights ."
Research questions	"Our focus in this article is on extra-role behavioremployees ' voluntary activities , which are not part of their prescribed duties ."
Research questions	"Specifically , we explored how user interface design can help increase extra-role behavior among crowdsourcing workers ."
Research method	"In a randomized experiment , we examined the joint effects of the presentation of a performance display to crowdsourcing workers and the personal attributes of these workers on the workers ' likelihood to engage in extra-role behavior ."
Research method	The experimental setting included an image analysis task performed on an environmental monitoring website .
Research findings/conclusions	We compared workers ' behavior across the different experimental conditions and found that the interaction between the presence of a performance display and the workers ' personality trait of curiosity has a significant impact on the likelihood of engaging in extra-role behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the presence of a performance display was associated with increased likelihood of extra-role behavior among low-curiosity workers , and no change in extra-role behavior was observed among high-curiosity users ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications for design are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"As such , PAC provides a framework for a theory of research evaluation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study examined the success factors of online posts from organizations in evoking a high level of response from group members .
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , appeals to community belongingness were discovered to be effective at motivating user engagement on social media ."
Research method	"The impact of community-focused language on garnering likes , comments , and shares was assessed using a methodology that combined text analytics , supervised machine learning , and multilevel regression ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In 51,760 postings from 100 academic libraries , it was found that general community appeals increase likes by 60 % , comments by 130 % , and shares by 39 % , whereas specific intracommunity , locally meaningful references increase likes by 16 % and shares by 12 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions have both theoretical implications , as they constitute a large-scale , empirical confirmation of the belongingness hypothesis from social psychology , and practical implications , as they suggest best practices for maintaining an organizational online presence ."
Research method	"To steer readers ' attention to the most important papers , journals use several techniques ( e.g. , lead paper ) ."
Research questions	"Angewandte Chemie International Edition ( AC ) , a leading international journal in chemistry , signals high-quality papers through designating them as a very important paper ( VIP ) ."
Research questions	"This study aims to investigate the citation impact of Communications in AC receiving the special feature VIP , both cumulated and over time ."
Research method	"Using propensity score matching , treatment group ( VIP ) and control group ( non-VIP ) were balanced for 14 covariates to estimate the unconfounded average treatment effect on the treated for the VIP designation ."
Research method	"Out of N = 3,011 Communications published in 2007 and 2008 , N = 207 received the special feature VIP ."
Research method	"For each Communication , data were collected from AC ( e.g. , referees ' ratings ) and from the databases Chemical Abstracts ( e.g. , sections ) and the Web of Science ( e.g. , citations ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The estimated unconfounded average treatment effect on the treated ( that is , Communications designated as a VIP ) was statistically significant and amounted to 19.83 citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the special feature VIP fostered the cumulated annual citation growth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For instance , the time until a Communication reached its maximum annual number of citations , was reduced ."
Research questions	"Currently more art than science , UE has gained theoretical and methodological traction over the past decade , yet there is still a need to establish empirical links between UE and desired outcomes ( e.g. , learning , behavior change ) , and to understand the myriad user , system , contextual , and so on , factors that predict successful digital engagement ."
Research questions	"This paper focuses on the relationship between UE and media format as a potential antecedent , and the outcome of learning , operationalized as short-term knowledge retention ."
Research method	"Participants interacted with two human-interest stories in one of four media formats : video , audio , narrative text , or transcript-style text ; short-term knowledge retention was measured using post-task multiple choice and short-answer questions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It was anticipated that format would have a strong effect on UE , and that more engaged users would recall more information about the stories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , these hypotheses were not fully supported , and the nature of the relationship between UE and learning was more nuanced than expected ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This research has implications for the design of information systems and , more fundamentally , the impetus to make digital environments engaging ."
Research questions	"Little is known about professional information practices or actions outside of traditional , centralized offices ; however , the dynamic , unconventional , and less stable mobile work context diverges substantially from this model , and presents significant challenges and opportunities for the accomplishing of work tasks ."
Research method	"This article identifies 5 main information practices geared toward mobilizing work , based on in-depth interviews with 31 mobile knowledge workers ( MKWs ) ."
Research questions	It then uses these 5 practices as starting points for beginning to delineate the context of mobile knowledge work .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the information practices and information contexts of MKWs are mutually constitutive : challenges and opportunities of their work arrangements are what enable the development of practices that continually ( re ) construct productive spatial , temporal , social , and material contexts for work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article contributes to an empirical understanding of the information practices of an increasingly visible yet understudied population , and to a theoretical understanding of the contemporary mobile knowledge work information context ."
Research method	"In this study we use complete publication data for all researchers employed at Norwegian universities over a 4-year period , linked to biographic data for each researcher ."
Research method	"Using this detailed and complete data set , we compare research productivity between five main scientific domains ( and subfields within them ) , across academic positions , and in terms of age and gender ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study 's key finding is that researchers from medicine , natural sciences , and technology are most productive when whole counts of publications are used , while researchers from the humanities and social sciences are most productive when article counts are fractionalized according to the total number of authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	The strong differences between these fields in publishing forms and patterns of coauthorship raise questions as to whether publication indicators can justifiably be used for comparison of productivity across scientific disciplines .
Research questions	Their potential influence on decision making is the focus of the present research .
Research questions	"Based on interplay between Social Judgment Theory and Framing Theory this study investigates whether the information delivered by technology blogs is treated differently during investment decision making than information from traditional financial newspapers in digital form , while containing information cues and text framing ."
Research method	"Using an online experiment with a 3 x 2 design , this research compares the influence of this trio of variables on the investment decisions of 236 participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results indicate a complex investment decision-making process differing according to the type of medium presented , the text framing , the information cues , and the decision maker 's background ."
Research method	Seed selection refers to choosing an initial sample set to label to form an initial learning model .
Research method	Sample selection refers to selecting informative samples to update the model at each iteration of the active learning process .
Research findings/conclusions	"Compared to supervised machine learning approaches , active learning offers the opportunity to build statistical classifiers with a reduced amount of training samples that require manual annotation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Reducing the manual annotation effort can support automating the clinical information extraction process .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This is particularly beneficial in the clinical domain , where manual annotation is a time-consuming and costly task , as it requires extensive labor from clinical experts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our empirical Research findings/conclusions demonstrate that ( a ) using sequence representations along with the length of sequence for seed selection shows potential towards more effective initial models , and ( b ) using sequence representations for sample selection leads to significantly lower manual annotation efforts , with up to 3 % and 6 % fewer tokens and concepts requiring annotation , respectively , compared to state-of-the-art query strategies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Recently , text mining was adopted to augment journal ranking-based evaluation with the content analysis of a discipline taking a time-variant factor into consideration ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , previous studies focused mainly on a silo analysis of a discipline using either citation-or content-oriented approaches , and no attempt was made to analyze topical journal ranking and its change over time in a seamless and integrated manner ."
Research method	"To address this issue , we propose a journal-time-topic model , an extension of Dirichlet multinomial regression , which we applied to the field of bioinformatics to understand journal contribution to topics in a field and the shift of topic trends ."
Research findings/conclusions	The journal-time-topic model allows us to identify which journals are the major leaders in what topics and the manner in which their topical focus .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also helps reveal an interesting distinct pattern in the journal impact factor of high- and low-ranked journals .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study results shed a new light for understanding topic specific journal rankings and shifts in journals ' concentration on a subject .
Research method	F1000Prime is a postpublication peer review system of the biomedical literature ( papers from medical and biological journals ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study is concerned with the interrater reliability and convergent validity of the peer recommendations formulated in the F1000Prime peer review system .
Research method	"The study is based on about 100,000 papers with recommendations from faculty members ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Even if intersubjectivity plays a fundamental role in science , the analyses of the reliability of the F1000Prime peer review system show a rather low level of agreement between faculty members ."
Research findings/conclusions	This result is in agreement with most other studies that have been published on the journal peer review system .
Research method	Logistic regression models are used to investigate the convergent validity of the F1000Prime peer review system .
Research findings/conclusions	"As the results show , the proportion of highly cited papers among those selected by the faculty members is significantly higher than expected ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , better recommendation scores are also associated with higher performing papers ."
Research questions	We start by critically examining Westin 's conceptualization of information privacy and argue for a contextual approach that holds promise for overcoming some of Westin 's weaknesses .
Research method	"We then highlight three contextual considerations for studying privacy-digital networks , marginalized populations , and the global context-and close by discussing how these considerations advance privacy theorization and technology design ."
Research questions	Modeling these dynamic contextual effects is an important challenge facing the research community because it has the potential to lead to more responsive search systems .
Research method	"With this motivation , a study of software engineers was conducted to understand the role that contextual factors play in shaping their information-seeking behavior ."
Research method	"Research was conducted in the field in a large technology company and comprised six unstructured interviews , a focus group , and 13 in-depth , semistructured interviews ."
Research method	Qualitative analysis revealed a set of contextual factors and related information behaviors .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Results are formalized in the contextual model of source selection , the main contributions of which are the identification of two types of conditioning variables ( requirements and constraints ) that mediate between the contextual factors and source-selection decisions , and the articulation of dominant source-selection patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study has implications for the design of context-sensitive search systems in this domain and may inform contextual approaches to information seeking in other professional domains .
Research method	"First , we present Indexing by latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDI ) , an automatic document indexing method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Many ad hoc applications , or their variants with smoothing techniques suggested in LDA-based language modeling , can result in unsatisfactory performance as the document representations do not accurately reflect concept space ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To improve document retrieval performance , we introduce a new definition of document probability vectors in the context of LDA and present a novel scheme for automatic document indexing based on LDA ."
Research questions	"Second , we propose an Ensemble Model ( EnM ) for document retrieval ."
Research method	EnM combines basic indexing models by assigning different weights and attempts to uncover the optimal weights to maximize the mean average precision .
Research method	"To solve the optimization problem , we propose an algorithm , which is derived based on the boosting method ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of our computational experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that both the proposed approaches are viable options for document retrieval .
Research questions	"Building on our previous study demonstrating enhanced engagement in citizen science through social information about others ' contributions , we propose a novel framework for effective telerehabilitation that integrates citizen science and social information into physical exercise ."
Research questions	We hypothesized that social information about others ' contributions would augment engagement in physical activity by encouraging people to invest more effort toward discovery of novel information in a citizen science context .
Research method	We recruited healthy participants to monitor the environment of a polluted canal by tagging images using a haptic device toward gathering environmental information .
Research method	"Along with the images , we displayed the locations of the tags created by the previous participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that participants increased both the amount and duration of physical activity when presented with a larger number of the previous tags .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , they increased the diversity of tagged objects by avoiding the locations tagged by the previous participants , thereby generating richer information about the environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results suggest that social information is a viable means to augment engagement in rehabilitation exercise by incentivizing the contribution to scientific activities .
Research questions	"Few , if any , studies , however , examine scientists ' problem-solving uses of PubMed in actual contexts of work and corresponding needs for better tool support ."
Research method	"Addressing this gap , we conducted a field study of novice scientists ( 14 upper-level undergraduate majors in molecular biology ) as they engaged in a problem-solving activity with PubMed in a laboratory setting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions reveal many common stages and patterns of information seeking across users as well as variations , especially variations in cognitive search styles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these Research findings/conclusions , we suggest tool improvements that both confirm and qualify many results found in other recent studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions highlight the need to use results from context-rich studies to inform decisions in tool design about when to offer improved features to users .
Research questions	"In this article , we build on two current lines of research ."
Research method	"( a ) We use Waisda ? , an existing labeling game , to add timebased annotations to content ."
Research questions	"( b ) In this context , we investigate the role of experts in human-based computation ( nichesourcing ) ."
Research method	We report on a small-scale experiment in which we applied Waisda ?
Research value/outlook/limitations	to content from film archives .
Research questions	We study the differences in the type of timebased tags between experts and novices for film clips in a crowdsourcing setting .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions show high similarity in the number and type of tags ( mostly factual ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the less frequent tags , however , experts used more domain-specific terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that competitive games are not suited to elicit real expert-level descriptions .
Research findings/conclusions	"We also confirm that providing guidelines , based on conceptual frameworks that are more suited to moving images in a time-based fashion , could result in increasing the quality of the tags , thus allowing for creating more tag-based innovative services for online audiovisual heritage ."
Research method	"To enable integrated searches , the proposed WikiMap ( + ) integrates search functions and IV tools ( i.e. , a topic network and hierarchical topic tree ) and gathers information from Wikipedia pages and Google Search results ."
Research method	"To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed interfaces , we design subject-oriented tasks and adopt extended evaluation measures ."
Research method	"We recruited 48 novices and 48 knowledgeable users , that is , intermediates , for the evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that novices using the proposed interface demonstrate better search performance than intermediates using Wikipedia .
Research findings/conclusions	We therefore conclude that our tools help close the gap between novices and intermediates in information searches .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results also show that intermediates can take advantage of the search tool by leveraging the IV tools to browse subtopics , and formulate better queries with less effort ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that embedding the IV and the search tools in the interface can result in different search behavior but improved task performance .
Research findings/conclusions	We provide implications to design search systems to include IV features adapted to user levels of subject knowledge to help them achieve better task performance .
Research questions	"As adoption of innovations and CSR commitment are linked with firm size and national culture/legislation , we hypothesize that size and national culture/legislation , may have an effect on WA level ."
Research method	The authors studied an international sample made up of companies included in EUROSTOXX600 ( The STOXX Europe 600 Index ) .
Research findings/conclusions	The main results suggest that both size and culture have a significant effect on WA .
Research findings/conclusions	Large firms as well as Anglo-Saxon companies are more prone to have higher WA levels .
Research findings/conclusions	"A deeper analysis , which was done through the estimation of quantile regression equations , showed that the influence of size is significant for companies trying to excel or for those trying to avoid the worst WA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the effect of size is significant only in the lowest part of the conditional distribution ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Intuitively , when we read , more important words will occupy a longer reading time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , by leveraging human reading time , we can find the salient words in the corresponding content ."
Research questions	"However , previous studies on keyphrase extraction ignore human reading features ."
Research questions	"In this article , we aim to leverage human reading time to extract keyphrases from microblog posts ."
Research questions	There are two main tasks in this study .
Research questions	One is to determine how to measure the time spent by a human on reading a word .
Research method	We use eye fixation durations ( FDs ) extracted from an open source eye-tracking corpus .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , we propose strategies to make eye FD more effective on keyphrase extraction ."
Research findings/conclusions	The other task is to determine how to integrate human reading time into keyphrase extraction models .
Research method	We propose two novel neural network models .
Research method	The first is a model in which the human reading time is used as the ground truth of the attention mechanism .
Research method	"In the second model , we use human reading time as the external feature ."
Research findings/conclusions	Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our proposed models yield better performance than the baseline models on two microblog datasets .
Research questions	"So far , automated tools have been developed either to account for the social networks among participants in the debates , or to analyze the content of these debates ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Less attention has been paid to mapping co-occurrences of actors ( participants ) and topics ( content ) in online debates that can be considered as socio-semantic networks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We propose a new , automated approach that uses the whole matrix of co-addressed topics and actors for understanding and visualizing online debates ."
Research method	"We show the advantages of the new approach with the analysis of two data sets : first , a large set of English-language Twitter messages at the Rio + 20 meeting , in June 2012 ( 72,077 tweets ) , and second , a smaller data set of Dutch-language Twitter messages on bird flu related to poultry farming in 2015-2017 ( 2,139 tweets ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We discuss the theoretical , methodological , and substantive implications of our approach , also for the analysis of other social media data ."
Research questions	"However , the use of IM at work remains controversial , owing to its unclear benefits to organizations ."
Research questions	"In this study , we employ media performance theories and the concept model of communicative ecology to examine the impact of an IM tool on shaping guanxi ( i.e. , interpersonal relationship ) networks in the workplace ."
Research questions	"Specifically , we propose that IM has the potential to enhance guanxi networks by improving communication quality and building interlocutors ' mutual trust in the workplace ."
Research method	The conceptual model is validated with 253 survey responses collected from working professionals in China .
Research findings/conclusions	The data indicate that communication quality and mutual trust contribute to the development of guanxi networks .
Research findings/conclusions	The theoretical and practical implications of the Research findings/conclusions are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	Uncertainties and ambiguities in the evaluation of percentile ranks can be demonstrated most easily with small data sets .
Research findings/conclusions	"But for larger data sets , an often large number of papers with the same citation count leads to the same uncertainties and ambiguities , which can be avoided by fractional scoring , demonstrated by four different empirical data sets with several thousand publications each , which are assigned to six percentile rank classes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Only by utilizing fractional scoring does , the total score of all papers exactly reproduce the theoretical value in each case ."
Research questions	"Despite efforts for the preservation of cultural heritages around the world , no well-accepted metadata schema has been developed for murals and stone cave temples , which are often high-value heritages built in ancient times ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , the literature is scarce on the user-centered evaluation of metadata schemas of this kind ."
Research questions	This study therefore aims to offer insights on developing and evaluating a metadata schema for organizing information of these historic and complex cultural heritages .
Research method	"In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 30 users , including 18 professional and 12 public users , and interview transcripts were coded through a qualitative content analysis approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions reveal the importance of specific metadata elements as perceived by the two groups of end users , which correlated with their cultural heritage information-seeking behaviors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the issues of standardization of cataloging of cultural heritage information and interoperability among metadata schemas have been raised by users for enhancing the user experience with digital platforms of cultural heritage information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The coding schema developed in this study can serve as a framework for follow-up evaluations of metadata schemas , contributing to the ongoing development of cultural heritage metadata ."
Research method	"The exercise was carried out in order to assess whether these highly sophisticated , state-of-the-art filters can distinguish between papers that are controversial or have gone past their sell-by date , and otherwise normal papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that not even the arXiv filters , which are otherwise successful in filtering fringe-topic papers , can fully acquire Domain-Specific Discrimination and thus distinguish technical papers that are taken seriously by an expert community from those that are not ."
Research questions	"Finally , we discuss the implications this has for citizen and policy-maker engagement with the Primary Source Knowledge of a technical domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	A key concern captured in these movements is that the metrics appear to carry authority even where established agents of quality control have explicitly outlined limits to their validity and reliability as measurement tools .
Research findings/conclusions	"This raises a number of challenging questions for those readers of this journal who are implicated in questions of indicator production and , by extension , effects ."
Research questions	In this opinion piece we wish to critically engage the question of how producers of indicators can come to terms with their role as ( partly ) responsible parties in the current age of evaluative bibliometrics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We do so through the illuminating case of the professional scientometrics community .
Research findings/conclusions	"The blogosphere is characterized by large amounts of noise , including incohesive , off-topic content and spam ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Consequently , the classical bag-of-words unigram IR models are not reliable enough to provide robust and effective retrieval performance ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose to boost the blog postretrieval performance by employing term proximity information ."
Research method	"We investigate a variety of popular and state-of-the-art proximity-based statistical IR models , including a proximity-based counting model , the Markov random field ( MRF ) model , and the divergence from randomness ( DFR ) multinomial model ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive experimentation on the standard TREC Blog06 test dataset demonstrates that the introduction of term proximity information is indeed beneficial to retrieval from the blogosphere .
Research findings/conclusions	Results also indicate the superiority of the unordered bi-gram model with the sequential-dependence phrases over other variants of the proximity-based models .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , inspired by the effectiveness of proximity models , we extend our study by exploring the proximity evidence between uery terms and opinionated terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	The consequent opinionated proximity model shows promising performance in the experiments .
Research method	We combine questions about Google 's business with task-based studies in which users were asked to distinguish between ads and organic results in screenshots of results pages .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that only a small percentage of users can reliably distinguish between ads and organic results , and that user knowledge of Google 's business model is very limited ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that ads are insufficiently labelled as such , and that many users may click on ads assuming that they are selecting organic results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most existing methods have two steps , weighting citation arcs based on search path counting and exploring main paths in a greedy fashion , with the assumption that citation networks are acyclic ."
Research findings/conclusions	The only available proposal that avoids manual cycle removal is to preprint transform a cyclic network to an acyclic counterpart .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Through a detailed discussion about the issues concerning this approach , especially deriving the de-preprinted main paths for the original network , this article proposes an alternative solution with two-fold contributions ."
Research method	"Based on the argument that a publication can not influence itself through a citation cycle , the SimSPC algorithm is proposed to weight citation arcs by counting simple search paths ."
Research method	A set of algorithms are further proposed for main path exploration and extraction directly from cyclic networks based on a novel data structure main path tree .
Research findings/conclusions	The experiments on two cyclic citation networks demonstrate the usefulness of the alternative solution .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the meanwhile , experiments show that publications in strongly connected components may sit on the turning points of main path networks , which signifies the necessity of a systematic way of dealing with citation cycles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The contributions of this study are twofold .
Research method	"First , I apply a fuzzy string matching algorithm for self-citation detection and benchmark this approach and other common methods of exclusively author name-based self-citation detection against a manually curated ground truth sample ."
Research findings/conclusions	Near full recall can be achieved with the proposed method while incurring only negligible precision loss .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , I report some important observations from the results about the extent of latent self-citations and their characteristics and give an example of the effect of improved self-citation detection on the document level self-citation rate of real data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Because only a small amount of social media data have been geolocation-annotated , inference techniques play a substantial role to increase the volume of annotated data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Conventional research in this area has been based on the text content of posts from a given user or the social network of the user , with some recent crossovers between the text- and network-based approaches ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper proposes a novel approach to categorize highly-mentioned users ( celebrities ) into Local and Global types , and consequently use Local celebrities as location indicators ."
Research method	A label propagation algorithm is then used over the refined social network for geolocation inference .
Research method	"Finally , we propose a hybrid approach by merging a text-based method as a back-off strategy into our network-based approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	Empirical experiments over three standard Twitter benchmark data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art user geolocation methods .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Exceeding traditional empirical approaches , Big Data opens a new perspective on scientific work in which data comes to play a role in the development of the scientific problematic to be developed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Addressing this reconfiguration of our relationship with data through readings of Wittgenstein , Macherey , and Popper , we propose a picture of science that encourages scientists to engage with the data in a direct way , using the data itself as an instrument for scientific investigation ."
Research questions	"Using GIS as a theme , we develop the concept of cyber-human systems of thought and understanding to bridge the divide between representative ( theoretical ) thinking and ( non-theoretical ) data-driven science ."
Research questions	"At the foundation of these systems , we invoke the concept of the semantic pixel to establish a logical and virtual space linking data and the work of scientists ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is with this discussion of the relationship between analysts in their pursuit of knowledge and the rise of Big Data that this present discussion of the philosophical foundations of Big Data addresses the central questions raised by social informatics research .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , Edinburgh Castle and Bodiam Castle are two objects of the same type : castle ."
Research method	"The question is whether specific information is requested for the object type castle and how this information differs for objects of other types ( e.g. , church , museum , or lake ) ."
Research method	We aim to answer this question using an online survey .
Research method	"In the survey , we showed 184 participants 200 images pertaining to urban and rural objects and asked them to write questions for which they would like to know the answers when seeing those objects ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis of the 6,169 questions collected in the survey shows that humans have shared ideas of what to ask about geographical objects ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When the object types resemble each other ( e.g. , church and temple ) , the requested information is similar for the objects of these types ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Otherwise , the information is specific to an object type ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results may be very useful in guiding Natural Language Processing tasks involving automatic generation of templates for image descriptions and their assessment , as well as image indexing and organization ."
Research questions	The aim of this study was to develop a scholar classification scheme from publication patterns in academic science .
Research questions	"Classification schemes are ways of describing groups that display different clusters of behaviors , approaches , or perspectives , and useful in the development of typologies ."
Research method	"In this research , sample data are selected from three representative universities , considered a leading university , a middle-tier university , and a noncomprehensive university ."
Research method	"A final set of 11,427 effective scholars and their 284,128 journal publication records were used to develop the classification scheme via cluster analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results identify six types of scholars , labeled as : singleton ( 8 % ) , small-team low performer ( 16 % ) , small-team high performer ( 17 % ) , big-team strategist ( 22 % ) , free-style follower ( 21 % ) , and life-time warrior ( 17 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	These six scholar types demonstrate different approaches to publishing that can be used to understand both individual and research team performance across different institutional settings .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , possible future work was identified that uses the scholar classification scheme to define the behavior for agents in an agent-based model to simulate the strategic-behavior-driven academic publication system ."
Research method	"The analysis studies 3 different information-seeking approaches : keyword searching , browsing , and case-based reasoning ( CBR ) searching provided by the system by examining the query logs that stretch over 8 years ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The longitudinal dimension of this study offers unique possibilities to see how users used the 3 different approaches over time .
Research method	Various user information-seeking patterns and trends are identified through the query usage pattern analysis and session analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	The study identified different user groups and found that a majority of the users tend to stick to their favorite information-seeking approach to meet their immediate information needs and do not seem to care whether alternative search options will offer greater benefits .
Research findings/conclusions	The study also found that return users used CBR searching much more frequently than 1-time users and tend to use more query terms to look for information than 1-time users .
Research questions	"Glanzel and Schoepflin ( 1994 ) first raised the issue of bibliometric standards in bibliometric research and this concern has been echoed by several additional bibliometric researchers over time ( Braun , 2010 ; Glanzel , 1996 ; Abbott , Cyranoski , Jones , Maher , Schiermeier , & Van Noorden , 2010 ; Lane , 2010 ; Nature , 2010 ; van Noorden , 2010 ; Wallin , 2005 ) ."
Research method	"We compare the characteristics of articles published within and outside the Library and Information Science ( LIS ) field , including the relative impact and the affiliation of the contributing authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that although the visibility of bibliometric articles within LIS is higher , it is not significant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , a statistically significant growth in the number of articles written by authors without a bibliometric affiliation was found ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article provides an independent empirical investigation of publication trends potentially underlying Gl nzel and Schoepflin 's ( 1994 ) concerns regarding the misuse of bibliometric results , and the inaccurate dissemination of concepts , results , and methods outside of the bibliometric field ."
Research questions	"As a starting point , this work investigates how the emotion of interest can be influenced by modifying the complexity of the information presented to users ."
Research findings/conclusions	The appraisal theory of interest suggests a sweet spot where interest will be at its peak : information that is novel and complex yet still comprehensible .
Research method	This sweet spot is approximated using two studies .
Research method	Study One develops a computational model of textual complexity founded on psycholinguistic theory on processing difficulty .
Research method	"The model was trained and tested on 12,420 articles , achieving a classification performance of 90.87 % on two classes of complexity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Study Two puts the model to its ultimate test : Its application to change the user 's IX .
Research method	Using 18 news articles the influence of complexity on interest and its appraisals is unveiled .
Research findings/conclusions	"A structural equation model shows a positive influence of complexity on interest , yet a negative influence of comprehensibility , confirming a seemingly paradoxical relationship between complexity and interest ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By showing when complexity becomes interesting , this paper shows how information systems can use the model of textual complexity to construct an interesting IX ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study is the first attempt to investigate the top three help-seeking situations as well as associated factors in blind users ' DL interactions .
Research method	A mixed-method approach was adopted for this study .
Research method	"Multiple methods were applied to collect data from 30 blind subjects : questionnaires , presearch interviews , think aloud protocols , transaction logs , and postsearch interviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The paper identifies the top three help-seeking situations , and associated factors in relation to user , system , task , and interaction ."
Research method	"Moreover , different types of main-level factors were tested to investigate if they are correlated to each type of top situation , and qualitative data of sublevel factors offer insight into how these factors are associated with various situations ."
Research questions	"Without a clear understanding of these situations and factors , the objective of universal access to information in DLs can not be achieved ."
Research questions	DL design implications are further discussed with the goal of providing system design recommendations for reducing blind users ' help-seeking situations .
Research questions	I employ affordances as a process concept to understand the recursive relationship between individuals and technologies and envision information practices as an outcome of this relationship .
Research method	"Guided by this conceptual framework , I conducted 30 semistructured interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals between the ages of 18 and 38 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Data analysis identified 3 key affordances that enable and constrain participants ' information practices : visibility , anonymity , and association ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate that participants are highly skilled in appropriating technological features to engage in desired information practices , such as seeking and creating ."
Research questions	"However , they also must contend with significant sociocultural barriers encoded into these features , which reinforce hetero- and cisnormative identity discourses ."
Research findings/conclusions	Library practitioners and systems designers can use these Research findings/conclusions to offer services and systems inclusive of LGBTQ+ populations .
Research method	We report Research findings/conclusions from interviews and focus groups with 49 UK state and voluntary sector professionals providing support to young ( < 21 ) mothers from areas of multiple deprivations .
Research findings/conclusions	We evidence an important information intermediary role with three key contributions to information behaviors in disadvantaged and dependent circumstances .
Research findings/conclusions	"Intermediaries : facilitate information needs recognition , and consider Research questionsful action within problematic situations ; are a key source of information in themselves , and a key integrative connection to other external sources not otherwise accessed ; and tailor and personalize information for relevance , and communicate via incremental and recursive cycles that take into account learning needs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We provide parameters for a theory of information intermediary intervention to guide future examination of an important and understudied role ; and conceptualize important theoretical relationships between information behavior and social capital , and in particular shared concepts of social integration , and the progressive and integrative intermediary role within ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions have significant practical implications for public health policy and digital health strategies , as they evidence an important human information intermediary role among an at-risk group , with implications for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations more broadly ."
Research questions	"With millions of users , these are a significant addition to the scholarly communication and academic information-seeking eco-structure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There is thus a need to understand the role that they play and the changes , if any , that they can make to the dynamics of academic careers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article investigates attributes of philosophy scholars on Academia.edu , introducing a median-based , time-normalizing method to adjust for time delays in joining the site ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In comparison to students , faculty tend to attract more profile views but female philosophers did not attract more profile views than did males , suggesting that academic capital drives philosophy uses of the site more than does friendship and networking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Secondary analyses of law , history , and computer science confirmed the faculty advantage ( in terms of higher profile views ) except for females in law and females in computer science ."
Research findings/conclusions	There was also a female advantage for both faculty and students in law and computer science as well as for history students .
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , Academia.edu overall seems to reflect a hybrid of scholarly norms ( the faculty advantage ) and a female advantage that is suggestive of general social networking norms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , traditional bibliometric measures did not correlate with any Academia.edu metrics for philosophers , perhaps because more senior academics use the site less extensively or because of the range informal scholarly activities that can not be measured by bibliometric methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Referees are expected to evaluate submissions equitably according to objective criteria ( e.g. , originality of the contribution , soundness of the theory , validity of the experiments ) ."
Research questions	We argue that the submission date of papers is a subjective factor playing a role in the way they are evaluated .
Research method	"Indeed , program committee ( PC ) chairs and referees process submission lists that are usually sorted by paperIDs ."
Research method	"This order conveys chronological information , as papers are numbered sequentially upon reception ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that order effects lead to unconscious favoring of early-submitted papers to the detriment of later-submitted papers .
Research findings/conclusions	Our point is supported by a study of 42 peer-reviewed conferences in Computer Science showing a decrease in the number of bids placed on submissions with higher paperIDs .
Research findings/conclusions	It is advised to counterbalance order effects during the bidding phase of peer review by promoting the submissions with fewer bids to potential referees .
Research findings/conclusions	This manipulation intends to better share bids out among submissions in order to attract qualified referees for all submissions .
Research findings/conclusions	"This would secure reviews from confident referees , who are keen on voicing sharp opinions and recommendations ( acceptance or rejection ) about submissions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This work contributes to the integrity of peer review , which is mandatory to maintain public trust in science ."
Research questions	"As these movements incorporate many of the past critiques concerning social fit and situational context leveled against them by Social Informatics research , more subtle and more deeply ingrained modes of ideological practice have risen to support movements of computerization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among these , the current emphasis on the promises of data and data analytics presents the most obvious ideological challenge ."
Research questions	"In order to reorient Social Informatics in relation to these new ideological challenges , Louis Althusser 's theory of ideology is discussed , with its implications for Social Informatics considered ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among these implications , a changed relationship between Social Informatics 's critical stance and its reliance on empirical methods is advanced ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Addressed at a fundamental level , the practice of Social Informatics comes to be reoriented in a more distinctly reflective and ethical direction ."
Research findings/conclusions	How they select targeted publications can influence competitive relationships among journals .
Research method	"In this paper , the author quantifies the publishing choices of a set of scholars to confirm this ecological perspective ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate a strong focus on a small number of journals .
Research method	"A measure of author publishing choices was used to define four ecological characteristics : coverage , coreness , exclusivity , and journal overlap ."
Research method	Several types of journals indexed in the Information Science and Library Science section of the Journal Citation Reports are compared in terms of their ecological characteristics .
Research findings/conclusions	"The data show that some journals cover large numbers of authors , but compete with other journals in subcommunities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Some journals with author profiles similar to those of high-ranking journals lost potential submissions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Others with low coverage , high coreness , and high exclusivity were found to have groups of fans who used them for all of their submissions , but still exhibited a strong need to sustain their exclusivity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is hoped that the method and results presented in this paper will provide useful information for editorial boards interested in managing their submissions according to author profiles .
Research questions	"The research objective was to identify , describe , and hypothesize about features of the behavior that are indicative of procedural knowledge gained during guided instruction ."
Research method	Log-data of search interaction were coded using a conceptual framework focused on components of search practice hypothesized to organize an expert searcher 's attention during search .
Research method	The coded data were analyzed using a measure of pointwise mutual information and state-transition analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	Results of the study provide important insight for future investigation of domain-independent search expertise and for the design of systems that assist searchers in gaining expertise .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Some work suggests that information may have social uses , hinting that information use is more complicated than previous frameworks suggest ."
Research questions	"Therefore , we use a micro-sociological , symbolic interactionist approach to examine the use of one type of informationbiomedical informationin the everyday life interactions of chronic illness patients and their families ."
Research method	"Based on a grounded theory analysis of 60 semi-structured interviews ( 30 individual patient interviews and 30 family group interviews ) and observations within the family group interviews , we identify 4 categories of information use : ( a ) knowing my body ; ( b ) mapping the social terrain ; ( c ) asserting autonomy ; and ( d ) puffing myself up ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Extending previous research , the Research findings/conclusions demonstrate use of biomedical information in interactions that construct a valued self for the patient : a person who holds authority , and who is unique and cared for ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In so doing , we contribute novel insights regarding the use of information to manage social emotions such as shame , and to construct embodied knowledge that is mobilized in action to address disease-related challenges ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We thus offer an expanded conceptualization of information use that provides new directions for research and practice .
Research method	The proposed extractive summarization method uses tags ( viewer- and author-assigned terms ) as key concepts .
Research method	Our method employs Flickr tag clusters and WordNet synonyms to expand tags and detect the semantic relations between tags .
Research method	This method helps select sentences that have a greater number of semantically related key concepts .
Research method	"To investigate the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed method , we compare it with an existing technique , latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) , using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of intrinsic evaluation show that the tag-based method is as or more effective than the LSA method .
Research findings/conclusions	"We also observe that in the extrinsic evaluation , the grand mean accuracy score of the tag-based method is higher than that of the LSA method , with a statistically significant difference ."
Research questions	"Elaborating on our results , we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our Research findings/conclusions for speech video summarization and retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	Google covers multiple different international patent office databases but does not index patent citations or allow automatic searches .
Research method	"In response , this article introduces a semiautomatic indirect method via Bing to extract and filter patent citations from Google to academic papers with an overall precision of 98 % ."
Research method	"The method was evaluated with 322,192 science and engineering Scopus articles from every second year for the period 1996-2012 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although manual Google Patent searches give more results , especially for articles with many patent citations , the difference is not large enough to be a major problem ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Within Biomedical Engineering , Biotechnology , and Pharmacology & Pharmaceutics , 7 % to 10 % of Scopus articles had at least one patent citation but other fields had far fewer , so patent citation analysis is only relevant for a minority of publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	Low but positive correlations between Google Patent citations and Scopus citations across all fields suggest that traditional citation counts can not substitute for patent citations when evaluating research .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Coauthor network analysis has been utilized to study scholars ' collaborations for a long time , but these studies have not simultaneously taken different collaboration features into consideration ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper , we present a systematic approach to analyze the differences in possibilities that two authors will cooperate as seen from the effects of homophily , transitivity , and preferential attachment ."
Research method	Exponential random graph models ( ERGMs ) are applied in this research .
Research findings/conclusions	We find that different types of publications one author has written play diverse roles in his/her collaborations .
Research findings/conclusions	"An author 's tendency to form new collaborations with her/his coauthors ' collaborators is strong , where the more coauthors one author had before , the more new collaborators he/she will attract ."
Research findings/conclusions	We demonstrate that considering the authors ' attributes and homophily effects as well as the transitivity and preferential attachment effects of the coauthorship network in which they are embedded helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	These give evidence that research Research findings/conclusions have been used to inform the day-to-day practice of medical staff .
Research questions	"To identify whether citations from guidelines can give different information from that of traditional citation counts , this article assesses the extent to which references in clinical guidelines tend to be highly cited in the academic literature and highly read in Mendeley ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using evidence from the United Kingdom , references associated with the UK 's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guidelines tended to be substantially more cited than comparable articles , unless they had been published in the most recent 3 years ."
Research findings/conclusions	Citation counts also seemed to be stronger indicators than Mendeley readership altmetrics .
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , although presence in guidelines may be particularly useful to highlight the contributions of recently published articles , for older articles citation counts may already be sufficient to recognize their contributions to health in society ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It does not , however , take into consideration the scholar 's position in the authorship list ."
Research findings/conclusions	"I recommend a new supplementary index to score academics , representing the relative contribution to the papers with impact , be reported alongside the h-index ."
Research method	"I call this index the AP-index , and it is simply defined as the average position in which an academic appears in authorship lists , on articles that factor in to that academic 's h-index ."
Research method	"We have therefore used it to study the scholarly output and impact of three scientific disciplines , management , economics , and sociology , in Spain and France , comparing some of the results with those retrieved with Scopus ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions show that scientific articles are the predominant form of scholarly communication in Google Scholar for our selected fields and countries .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , our results indicate that in Google Scholar the vernacular languages of each country are more used than English in all cases , but economics in France ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The opposite occurs in Scopus , except for the case of sociology articles in France We also show that books receive on average more citations than other published documents in Google Scholar ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we demonstrate that publishing in English is associated with greater scholarly impact , except for the case of France in Google Scholar for articles in sociology and books in the three fields ."
Research questions	"In this article , we scrutinize one of these cases where the continued use of technology can not be explained by one of the most prominent traditional IS models to date ."
Research method	"We analyze our qualitative case study by juxtaposing two theoretical lenses : a traditional IS perspective ( i.e. , the unified theory of acceptance and use model ) versus an evolutionary psychology perspective ( i.e. , the four-drive model ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that a more comprehensive understanding of continued IS usage is possible when including an evolutionary psychology perspective to the existing models .
Research questions	"Specifically , we propose three new concepts , including evolved performance expectancy , evolved effort expectancy , and evolved social influence ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also demonstrate that , in some situations , cognitive and social constructs dominate , whereas in other situations , the evolutionary dependent constructs associated with human nature take over ."
Research questions	"However , concerns remain over unequal technological access in our society , as political resources available on the internet empower those with the resources and motivation to take advantage of them , leaving those who are disengaged farther behind ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , those who face digital inequalities are not only deprived of the benefits of the so-called Information Society , they are also deprived of exercising their civic rights ."
Research questions	"To promote political engagement among the marginalized , we analyze different sociotechnical factors that may play a role in promoting their inclusion in future political activities ."
Research method	We employed a survey for marginalized communities to analyze a set of research questions relating to sociotechnical factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that online content creation , digital freedom , and access to the mobile Internet may positively impact political engagement ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The development of these factors may not only promote the inclusion of marginalized populations in future political events , but also help to build a more equal society where everyone 's voice has a chance to be heard ."
Research method	"The academic information collected in this data set is used to evaluate , analyze , and document the scientific production of research groups ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Information about the interactions between Brazilian researchers in the form of coauthorships , however , has not been analyzed ."
Research method	"In this article , we identified and characterized Brazilian academic coauthorship networks of researchers registered in the Lattes Platform using topological properties of graphs ."
Research method	"For this Research questions , we explored ( a ) strategies to develop a large Lattes curricula vitae data set , ( b ) an algorithm for identifying automatic coauthorships based on bibliographic information , and ( c ) topological metrics to investigate interactions among researchers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study characterized coauthorship networks to gain an in-depth understanding of the network structures and dynamics ( social behavior ) among researchers in all available major Brazilian knowledge areas .
Research method	"In this study , we evaluated information from a total of 1,131,912 researchers associated with the eight major Brazilian knowledge areas : agricultural sciences ; biological sciences ; exact and earth sciences ; humanities ; applied social sciences ; health sciences ; engineering ; and linguistics , letters , and arts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"They need a strategy to filter this barrage of massive data sets , and to find all of the information responding to their information needs , despite the pressures imposed by schedules and budgets ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this applied research , we present an exploratory search strategy that allows professional information seekers to efficiently and effectively triage all of the data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We demonstrate that exploratory search is particularly useful for information filtering and large-scale information triage , regardless of the language of the data , and regardless of the particular industry , whether finance , medical , business , government , information technology , news , or legal ."
Research method	"Our strategy reduces a dauntingly large volume of information into a manageable , high-precision data set , suitable for focused reading ."
Research method	"This strategy is interdisciplinary , integrating concepts from information filtering , information triage , and exploratory search ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Key aspects include advanced search software , interdisciplinary paired search , asynchronous collaborative search , attention to linguistic phenomena , and aggregated search results in the form of a search matrix or search grid ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We present the positive results of a task-oriented evaluation in a real-world setting , discuss these results from a qualitative perspective , and share future research areas ."
Research questions	"However , the role of journals has been called into question because new preprint archives and academic search engines make it easier to find articles independent of the journals that publish them ."
Research questions	Research on this issue is complicated by the deeply confounded relationship between article quality and journal reputation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We present an innovative proxy for individual article quality that is divorced from the journal 's reputation or impact factor : the number of citations to preprints posted on .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using this measure to study three subfields of physics that were early adopters of arXiv , we show that prior estimates of the effect of journal reputation on an individual article 's impact ( measured by citations ) are likely inflated ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While we find that higher-quality preprints in these subfields are now less likely to be published in journals compared to prior years , we find little systematic evidence that the role of journal reputation on article performance has declined ."
Research questions	"In recent times , there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in Twitter ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , these techniques are either not personal ( that is , consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user ) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device ."
Research questions	"Given that 80 % of active Twitter users access the site on mobile devices , in this article we present a lightweight , personal , on-demand , topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM , designed for such devices ."
Research method	"Specifically , TOTEM first preprocesses recent tweets in a user 's timeline and exploits Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based topic modeling to assign each preprocessed tweet to a topic ."
Research method	"Then it generates a ranked list of relevant tweets , a topic label , and a topic summary for each of the topics ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our experimental study with real-world data sets demonstrates the superiority of TOTEM .
Research questions	"The amount of funds and effort devoted to such projects is enormous , and now they are providing greater opportunities and convenience for researchers to view and make use of important , rare , and/or brittle historical materials ."
Research questions	"However , little attention has been paid in the information science field as to how much impact these projects to digitalize archival collections have had on actual historical research publications ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Existing studies are largely devoted to system designs and the user/usability interface , as well as users ' search behaviors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Little has been done to determine the direct relationship between digital resources and historical research .
Research method	"This study surveyed research articles in the field of history to observe how frequently and widely digital collections were used , what kinds of digital collections were used more extensively and for what Research questionss , and what the current status of digital archival collections among other resources is in historical research ."
Research method	Citations and figures in articles of the American Historical Review for the period 20012010 were analyzed with a specific focus on digital archives collection .
Research findings/conclusions	The usage patterns by material types and formats of references and the impacts of digital archival collections among other sources are identified from two perspectives of impact : intensity and extensity .
Research findings/conclusions	Observation of the direct relationships with digital collections and historical studies suggest some practical guidelines for future digital projects with concrete data .
Research questions	"One frequent research question has been how different conference and journal publications are , considering an article as a unit of analysis ."
Research method	"This study takes an author-based approach to analyze the publishing patterns of 517,763 scholars who have ever published both in CS conferences and journals for the last 57 years , as recorded in DBLP ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis shows that the majority of CS scholars tend to make their scholarly debut , publish more articles , and collaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Importantly , conference articles seem to serve as a distinct channel of scholarly communication , not a mere preceding step to journal publications : coauthors and title words of authors across conferences and journals tend not to overlap much ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study corroborates Research findings/conclusions of previous studies on this topic from a distinctive perspective and suggests that conference authorship in CS calls for more special attention from scholars and administrators outside CS who have focused on journal publications to mine authorship data and evaluate scholarly performance .
Research method	We examine the role of human values in shaping the Net neutrality debate through a content analysis of testimonies from U.S. Senate and FCC hearings on Net neutrality .
Research method	The analysis is based on a coding scheme that we developed based on a pilot study in which we used the Schwartz Value Inventory .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the policy debate surrounding Net neutrality revolves primarily around differences in the frequency of expression of the values of innovation and wealth , such that the proponents of Net neutrality more frequently invoke innovation , while the opponents of Net neutrality more frequently invoke wealth in their prepared testimonies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The paper provides a novel approach for examining the Net neutrality debate and sheds light on the connection between information policy and research on human values .
Research questions	A common challenge is to identify which aspects of online interaction influence user engagement the most .
Research method	"In this article , through an analysis of a news article collection obtained from Yahoo News US , we demonstrate that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content , depending on factors such as news provider and genre ."
Research method	"Moreover , through a laboratory study , we observe the effect of sentimentality and polarity of news and comments on a set of subjective and objective measures of engagement ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , we show that attention , affect , and gaze differ across news of varying interestingness ."
Research questions	"As part of our study , we also explore methods that exploit the sentiments expressed in user comments to reorder the lists of comments displayed in news pages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results indicate that user engagement can be anticipated predicted if we account for the sentimentality and polarity of the content as well as other factors that drive attention and inspire human curiosity .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research libraries and archives , as well as groups from within the humanities disciplines themselves , are being tasked with providing robust support for information management practices , including helping to engage humanities scholars with appropriate digital technologies in ways that are sensitive to disciplinary-based cultures and practices ."
Research questions	"However , infrastructure ( services , tools , and collaborative networks ) to support scholarly information significant barriers impede this work , primarily because the management is still under development ."
Research questions	Under the aegis of the Scholars Tracking Archival Resources ( STAR ) project we are studying how humanities scholars gather and manage primary source materials with a goal of developing software to support their information management practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"This article reports the Research findings/conclusions from our interviews with 26 humanities scholars , in conjunction with a set of initial requirements for a mobile application that will support scholars in capturing documents , recreating the archival context , and uploading these documents to cloud storage for access and sharing from other devices ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article reports the development and evaluation of CharaParser , a software application for semantic annotation of morphological descriptions ."
Research method	CharaParser annotates semistructured morphological descriptions in such a detailed manner that all stated morphological characters of an organ are marked up in Extensible Markup Language1 format .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a general Research questions syntactic parser as its key annotation tools , CharaParser requires minimal additional knowledge engineering work and seems to perform well across different description collections and/or taxon groups ."
Research method	"The system has been formally evaluated on over 1,000 sentences randomly selected from Volume 19 of Flora of North American and Part H of Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"CharaParser reaches and exceeds 90 % in sentence-wise recall and precision , exceeding other similar systems reported in the literature ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also significantly outperforms a heuristic rule-based system we developed earlier .
Research findings/conclusions	Early evidence that enriching the lexicon of a syntactic parser with domain terms alone may be sufficient to adapt the parser for the biodiversity domain is also observed and may have significant implications .
Research findings/conclusions	"In many cases , the collaborations are technology supported , meaning that the work is done through shared documents ."
Research method	We develop a framework articulating the characteristics of documents supporting collaborators with access to asymmetric knowledge versus those with access to symmetric knowledge .
Research questions	"Drawing on theories about document genre , boundary objects , and provenance , we hypothesize that documents supporting asymmetric collaborators are likely to articulate or prescribe their own ( a ) Research questions , ( b ) context of use , ( c ) content and form , and ( d ) provenance in greater detail than documents supporting symmetric collaborators ."
Research method	We explore these hypotheses through content analysis of documents and instructions for documents from a variety of free/libre open-source projects ( FLOSS ) .
Research findings/conclusions	We present Research findings/conclusions consistent with the hypotheses developed as well as results extending beyond our theory-derived assumptions .
Research findings/conclusions	"When participants have access to the same knowledge , the study suggests that prescriptions about the content of documents become less important compared with prescriptions about the context , provenance , and process of work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study contributes with a dynamic perspective on communicative practices that consider an often-uneven distribution of knowledge in virtual collaborations .
Research findings/conclusions	"When threats materialize , the consequences can be significant ."
Research questions	Most large organizations invest in a dedicated information security management ( ISM ) function to ensure that digital assets are protected .
Research findings/conclusions	"The ISM function conducts risk assessments , develops strategy , provides policies and training to define roles and guide behavior , and implements technological controls such as firewalls , antivirus , and encryption to restrict unauthorized access ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite these protective measures , incidents ( security breaches ) will occur ."
Research questions	"Alongside the security management function , many organizations also retain an incident response ( IR ) function to mitigate damage from an attack and promptly restore digital services ."
Research questions	"However , few organizations integrate and learn from experiences of these functions in an optimal manner that enables them to not only respond to security incidents , but also proactively maneuver the threat environment ."
Research questions	In this article we draw on organizational learning theory to develop a conceptual framework that explains how the ISM and IR functions can be better integrated .
Research findings/conclusions	"The strong integration of ISM and IR functions , in turn , creates learning opportunities that lead to organizational security benefits including : increased awareness of security risks , compilation of threat intelligence , removal of flaws in security defenses , evaluation of security defensive logic , and enhanced security response ."
Research method	"We examined a large-scale data file comprised of nearly 7,000,000 records spanning 33 consecutive months of a major US retailer 's search engine marketing campaign ."
Research method	The theoretical foundation is serial position effect to explain searcher behavior when interacting with ranked ad listings .
Research method	"We control for temporal effects and use one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tamhane 's T2 tests to examine the effect of ad rank on critical keyword advertising metrics , including clicks , cost-per-click , sales revenue , orders , items sold , and advertising return on investment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions show significant ad rank effect on most of those metrics , although less effect on conversion rates ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A primacy effect was found on both clicks and sales , indicating a general compelling performance of top-ranked ads listed on the first results page ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversion rates , on the other hand , follow a relatively stable distribution except for the top 2 ads , which had significantly higher conversion rates ."
Research questions	"However , examining conversion potential ( the effect of both clicks and conversion rate ) , we show that ad rank has a significant effect on the performance of keyword advertising campaigns ."
Research findings/conclusions	Conversion potential is a more accurate measure of the impact of an ad 's position .
Research findings/conclusions	"In fact , the first ad position generates about 80 % of the total profits , after controlling for advertising costs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition to providing theoretical grounding , the research results reported in this paper are beneficial to companies using search engine marketing as they strive to design more effective advertising campaigns ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As such , the current paper proposes a new measurement for quantifying journals ' diversity by utilizing the abstracts of scientific publications in journals , namely topic diversity ( TD ) ."
Research method	"Specifically , we apply a topic detection method to extract fine-grained topics , rather than disciplines , in journals and adapt certain diversity indicators to calculate TD ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Since TD only needs as inputs abstracts of publications rather than citing relationships between publications , this measurement has the potential to be widely used in scientometrics ."
Research method	Through 2 case studies we show how information and the genres used for communicating that information was perceived and used by the relevant agents involved with the genres .
Research method	"Based on the case studies , we conclude by discussing how the fields of information history and rhetorical genre theory can inform each other ."
Research questions	"In this brief communication , we assess some of the methodological difficulties that have arisen in this context ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These difficulties encompass issues of data availability , suitability of indicators , nature and Research questions of tables and graphs , and the role of supplementary information ."
Research questions	"In particular , this study aims to investigate the potentials of imparting richer collective intelligence to existing knowledge representation systems in health ."
Research questions	"The study focuses on detecting semantic relationships between semantic groups of major concepts mined from health consumers ' descriptions of health issues and associated user-generated metadata ( i.e. , tags ) ."
Research method	"A total of 50,263 blogs and associated 341,720 tags were collected from Tumblr , a blogging social networking site ."
Research method	"Text mining and semantic network analysis methods were used to explore the usage patterns at semantic type levels of the identified medical concepts in tags , in blogs , and between tags and blogs ."
Research findings/conclusions	More various associations among semantic types were identified both in tags and in blogs .
Research findings/conclusions	These associations were more diverse and complicated than the relationships in the Unified Medical Language System Semantic Network .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the groups of concepts in tags and blogs , groups showed relatively stronger and more diverse relationships with other groups of concepts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , many direct and close relations were found between tags and blogs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Conventional measures are brittle : They estimate the surface overlap between documents based on the words they mention and ignore deeper semantic connections .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We propose a new measure that assesses similarity at both the lexical and semantic levels , and learns from human judgments how to combine them by using machine-learning techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments show that the new measure produces values for documents that are more consistent with people 's judgments than people are with each other .
Research findings/conclusions	"We also use it to classify and cluster large document sets covering different genres and topics , and find that it improves both classification and clustering performance ."
Research method	"Narrative inquiry was used as a research method , allowing two focus groupsone composed of teens and the other of undergraduate studentsto map out 4 cyberbullying stories ."
Research findings/conclusions	Each cyberbullying story revealed 2 subplotsthe story that is ( as perceived by these participants ) and the story that could be ( if the participants ' design recommendations were embedded in social media ) .
Research findings/conclusions	The study resulted in a user-generated framework for designing affordances on social media sites to counter acts of cyberbullying .
Research findings/conclusions	"Seven emergent design themes are evident in the participants ' cyberbullying narratives : design for hesitation , design for consequence , design for empathy , design for personal empowerment , design for fear , design for attention , and design for control and suppression ."
Research method	"We conclude with a typological analysis of the values present in the participants ' design recommendations , applying Cheng and Fleischman 's values framework ( 2010 ) ."
Research questions	This study aimed to develop an analytical framework to identify self-disclosing health information with unusual messages on web forums by leveraging advanced text-mining techniques .
Research method	"To demonstrate the performance of the proposed analytical framework , we conducted an experimental study on 2 major human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) /acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) forums in Taiwan ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the classification accuracy increased significantly ( up to 83.83 % ) when using features selected by the information gain technique .
Research findings/conclusions	The results also show the importance of adopting domain-specific features in analyzing unusual messages on web forums .
Research findings/conclusions	This study has practical implications for the prevention and support of HIV/AIDS healthcare .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , public health agencies can re-allocate resources and deliver services to people who need help via social media sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , individuals can also join a social media site to get better suggestions and support from each other ."
Research questions	Strategies to streamline data management across disciplines are of key importance .
Research method	"This paper presents results of an institutional survey ( N = 258 ) at a medium-sized Austrian university with a STEM focus , supplemented with interviews ( N = 18 ) , to give an overview of the state-of-play of RDM practices across faculties and disciplinary contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"RDM services are on the rise but remain somewhat behind leading countries like the Netherlands and UK , showing only the beginnings of a culture attuned to RDM ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There is considerable variation between faculties and institutes with respect to data amounts , complexity of data sets , data collection and analysis , and data archiving ."
Research questions	Data sharing practices within fields tend to be inconsistent .
Research questions	"RDM is predominantly regarded as an administrative task , to the detriment of considerations of good research practice ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Problems with RDM fall in two categories : Generic problems transcend specific research interests , infrastructures , and departments while discipline-specific problems need a more targeted approach ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The paper extends the state-of-the-art on RDM practices by combining in-depth qualitative material with quantified , detailed data about RDM practices and needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions should be of interest to any comparable research institution with a similar agenda .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous research dealing with privacy concerns has studied mostly worries about information misuse , focusing on the protection aspects of privacy ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By adopting an interpersonal conception of privacy and communication privacy management theory , this study offers a new way of understanding privacy concerns by examining the social and presentational aspects of privacy ."
Research questions	It examines privacy concerns in terms not only of others ' misuse but of others ' misunderstanding and personal information in terms not only of identity but of self-presentational information .
Research questions	"Furthermore , it investigates the ways in which information and social risks inherent in SNS influence privacy concerns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A structural equation modeling analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 396 Facebook users finds that longer usage does not alleviate the impact of information risk on either concern , that a greater proportion of offline friends among one 's SNS friends aggravates the impact of social risk on both concerns , and that concerns about information misuse affect the provision only of identity information , whereas concerns about information misunderstanding affect the provision of both identity and self-presentational information ."
Research questions	"Although they are well studied in the literature , little research examines how sociotechnical design changes influence the sustainability of support communities for different medical conditions ."
Research method	"We compare the impact of a single design change on 49 disease-specific health support forums hosted on the WebMD platform , a popular online health information service ."
Research method	A statistical analysis showcases changes in posting patterns before and after the design intervention ; a subsequent interpretive examination of forum content reveals how the design change affected members ' perceived affordances of the platform .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that , despite differences between communities , the design change triggered a common set of cascading effects : it made it difficult for core users to create and maintain relationships , that led them to ultimately leave the site , and , in turn , reduced the activity drawing newcomers to the platform ."
Research questions	"Using these Research findings/conclusions , we argue that the design of sustainable and robust online communities must account for systemic , sociotechnical dynamics ."
Research method	"Through the analysis of scientific production indexed in the Web of Science for the years 2006-2010 , the new knowledge is classified in subject categories and mapped according to an algorithm for the reconciliation of authors ' affiliations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike other studies in the literature based on simple counting of publications , the present study adopts an indicator , Scientific Strength , which takes account of both the quantity of scientific production and its impact on the advancement of knowledge ."
Research method	The differences in the results that arise from the 2 approaches are examined .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of works of this kind can inform public research policies , at national and local levels , as well as the localization strategies of research-based companies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Scientific impact , particularly , plays a significant role in the academia ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper attempts to understand researchers ' career trajectories by considering the research community as a social network , where individuals build ties with each other via coauthorship ."
Research findings/conclusions	The resulting linkage facilitates information flow and affects researchers ' future impact .
Research questions	"Consequently , we systematically investigate the career trajectories of researchers with respect to research impact using the social capital theory as our theoretical foundation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , for early-stage and mid-career academics , we find that connections with prominent researchers associate with greater impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Brokerage positions , in addition , are beneficial to a researcher 's research impact in the long run ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For senior researchers , however , the only social network feature that significantly affects their future impact is the reputation of their recently built ties ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we build predictive models on future research impact which can be leveraged by both organizations and individuals ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides empirical evidence for how social networks provide signals on researchers ' career dynamics guided by social capital theory .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions have implications for individual researchers to strategically plan and promote their careers and for research institutions to better evaluate current as well as prospective employees .
Research method	"We contacted these authors to ask about their research processes , with regard to digital archival collections , and their perceptions of the usefulness of digital archival collections to historical research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study presents a realistic portrayal of the uses and impacts of digital primary sources from the perspectives of historians who use digital collections for their research projects .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions from this study indicate that digital archival collections are important source materials for historical studies for various reasons .
Research questions	"However , the amount of authority digital materials possess as historical resources was disputed ."
Research questions	"Many historians preferred documents in their original form , but historians ' preferences began to change as they increasingly consulted digital formats ."
Research questions	"As the web has developed into an important research platform , historians have adopted different research patterns , one of which is using random web searches to find digital primary sources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Historians ' understandings of the use of digital archival collections revealed a spectrum of activities including finding , understanding , interpreting , and citing digital information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Historians in this study worked concurrently on multiple studies or on a larger project for a book , and each of their searches for digital collections had the potential to provide them with useful results for several research studies ."
Research method	"In a naturalistic setting and across a range of curriculum areas , it investigated the behavior of secondary school students undertaking information search tasks ."
Research method	Research questions focused on students ' criteria for assessing the relevance and reliability of information .
Research method	Thirty-seven students between 14 and 17 years of age from a southeastern Australian school participated .
Research method	"The study collected data from journals ; interviews , including video-stimulated recall interviews ; think-aloud reports ; video screen captures ; and questionnaires ."
Research method	Data analysis culminated in grounded theory .
Research method	"Initial judgments of an item 's relevance were based on comprehensibility , completeness of source , whether the item needed to be purchased , whether video sources were suitable , and whether factual or opinionative material met students ' needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants preferred information that provided topic overviews , information that linked to prior knowledge , and sources that treated topics in acceptable depth and were structured to facilitate accessibility ."
Research method	Students derived clues about reliability from URLs and considered the reputation of sources .
Research findings/conclusions	"The ability of an item to corroborate prior knowledge , its graphic design , its style of writing , and the perceived authority of its creators influenced participants ' decisions about reliability ."
Research method	A unique dataset of Airbnb listings in Beijing is collected to perform an empirical analysis and a model simulation .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of this study demonstrate that the spillover of listings ' recommendation information decays with spatial distance and this decay follows a certain attenuation mode ( i.e. , has a certain attenuation rate and attenuation point ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As one of the first to investigate the attenuation mechanism of information spillover , this communication enriches the current research on information transmission and brings a novel topic to the attention of the community ."
Research questions	"Previous studies have attempted to infer influence from blog features , but they have ignored the possible influence styles that describe the different ways in which influence is exerted ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a novel approach to analyzing bloggers ' influence styles and using the influence styles as features to improve the performance of influence diffusion detection among linked bloggers .
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed influence style ( INFUSE ) model describes bloggers ' influence through their engagement style , persuasion style , and persona ."
Research method	"Methods used include similarity analysis to detect the creating-sharing aspect of engagement style , subjectivity analysis to measure persuasion style , and sentiment analysis to identify persona style ."
Research method	We further extend the INFUSE model to detect influence diffusion among linked bloggers based on the bloggers ' influence styles .
Research findings/conclusions	The INFUSE model performed well with an average F1 score of 76 % compared with the in-degree and sentiment-value baseline approaches .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous studies have focused on the existence of influence among linked bloggers in detecting influence diffusion , but our INFUSE model is shown to provide a fine-grained description of the manner in which influence is diffused based on the bloggers ' influence styles ."
Research questions	More researchers are designing and evaluating interactive information retrieval ( IIR ) systems and beginning to innovate in evaluation methods .
Research questions	"Maturation of a research specialty relies on the ability to replicate research , provide standards for measurement and analysis , and understand past endeavors ."
Research method	This article presents a historical overview of 40 years of IIR evaluation studies using the method of systematic review .
Research method	"A total of 2,791 journal and conference units were manually examined and 127 articles were selected for analysis in this study , based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria ."
Research method	"These articles were systematically coded using features such as author , publication date , sources and references , and properties of the research method used in the articles , such as number of subjects , tasks , corpora , and measures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results include data describing the growth of IIR studies over time , the most frequently occurring and cited authors and sources , and the most common types of corpora and measures used ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"An additional product of this research is a bibliography of IIR evaluation research that can be used by students , teachers , and those new to the area ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To the authors ' knowledge , this is the first historical , systematic characterization of the IIR evaluation literature , including the documentation of methods and measures used by researchers in this specialty ."
Research findings/conclusions	The existence of those transitions could be regarded because of the diversity in collaboration behaviors of scientific fields .
Research method	"A growing geometric hypergraph built on a cluster of concentric circles is proposed to model two specific collaboration behaviors , namely the behaviors of research team leaders and those of the other team members ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The model successfully predicts the transitions , as well as many common features of coauthorship networks ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Particularly , it realizes a process of deriving the complex scale-free property from the simple yes/no decisions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it provides a reasonable explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of collaboration behaviors between leaders and other members ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The difference emerges in the evolution of research teams , which synthetically addresses several specific factors of generating collaborations , namely the communications between research teams , academic impacts and homophily of authors ."
Research method	"Using the full text of 45,000 papers published in the PLoS series of journals as a case study , this paper investigates , from the viewpoint of bibliometrics , how references are distributed along the structure of scientific papers as well as the age of these cited references ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Once the sections of articles are realigned to follow the IMRaD sequence , the position of cited references along the text of articles is invariant across all PLoS journals , with the introduction and discussion accounting for most of the references ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It also provides evidence that the age of cited references varies by section , with older references being found in the methods and more recent references in the discussion ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These results provide insight into the different roles citations have in the scholarly communication process .
Research method	This study presents a general bibliometric analysis on the new funding acknowledgment ( FA ) information available in the Web of Science .
Research method	All publications covered by the database in 2009 have been analyzed .
Research findings/conclusions	"The presence and length of the FA text , as well as the presence of peer interactive communication in the acknowledgments , are related to impact indicators , distribution of papers by fields , countries of the authors , and collaboration level of the papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is observed that publications with FAs present a higher impact as compared with publications without them .
Research findings/conclusions	There are also differences across countries and disciplines in the share of publications with FAs and the acknowledgment of peer interactive communication .
Research findings/conclusions	"China is the country with the highest share of publications acknowledging funding , while the presence of FAs in the humanities and social sciences is very low compared to the more basic disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	The presence of peer interactive communication in acknowledgments can be linked to countries that have a strong scientific tradition and are incorporated in scientific networks .
Research findings/conclusions	Peer interactive communication is also common in the fields of humanities and social sciences and can be linked to lower levels of co-authorship .
Research findings/conclusions	Observed patterns are explained and topics of future research are proposed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As a technique , it is more interested in the what than in the why of data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It does not need theories that explain how things work , it just needs the results ."
Research questions	"As a science , however , working strictly from data and without theories contradicts the post-empiricist view of science ."
Research questions	"In this view , theories come before data and data is used to corroborate or falsify theories ."
Research questions	"Nevertheless , one of the most controversial statements about Data Science is that it is a science that can work without theories ."
Research method	"In this conceptual paper , we focus on the science aspect of Data Science ."
Research questions	How is Data Science as a science ?
Research method	We propose a three-phased view of Data Science that shows that different theories have different roles in each of the phases we consider .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We focus on when theories are used in Data Science rather than the controversy of whether theories are used in Data Science or not .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the end , we will see that the statement Data Science works without theories is better put as in some of its phases , Data Science works without the theories that originally motivated the creation of the data ."
Research questions	"As an alternative and motivated by the success of term familiarity , we test a complementary measure : grammar familiarity ."
Research method	Grammar familiarity is measured as the frequency of the 3rd level sentence parse tree and is useful for evaluating individual sentences .
Research method	We created a database of 140K unique 3rd level parse structures by parsing and binning all 5.4M sentences in English Wikipedia .
Research method	We then calculated the grammar frequencies across the corpus and created 11 frequency bins .
Research method	We evaluate the measure with a user study and corpus analysis .
Research method	"For the user study , we selected 20 sentences randomly from each bin , controlling for sentence length and term frequency , and recruited 30 readers per sentence ( N = 6,600 ) on Amazon Mechanical Turk ."
Research method	"We measured actual difficulty ( comprehension ) using a Cloze test , perceived difficulty using a 5-point Likert scale , and time taken ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Sentences with more frequent grammatical structures , even with very different surface presentations , were easier to understand , perceived as easier , and took less time to read ."
Research findings/conclusions	Outcomes from readability formulas correlated with perceived but not with actual difficulty .
Research findings/conclusions	Our corpus analysis shows how the metric can be used to understand grammar regularity in a broad range of corpora .
Research findings/conclusions	Highly cited papers serve as a proxy for excellence and coauthored papers as a measure of collaborative efforts .
Research findings/conclusions	We find that currently research institutes ( of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as others ) remain the key players despite recent government initiatives to stimulate university science .
Research findings/conclusions	The contribution of the commercial sector to high-impact research is negligible .
Research findings/conclusions	"More than 90 % of Russian highly cited papers involve international collaboration , and Russian institutions often do not play a dominant role ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Partnership with U.S. , German , U.K. , and French scientists increases markedly the probability of a Russian paper becoming highly cited ."
Research findings/conclusions	Patterns of national ( intranational ) collaboration in world-class research differ significantly across different types of organizations ; the strongest ties are between three nuclear/particle physics centers .
Research method	"Finally , we draw a coauthorship map to visualize collaboration between Russian centers of excellence ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Recent research has developed sophisticated financial polarity lexicons for investigating how financial sentiments relate to future company performance .
Research questions	"However , based on experience from fields that commonly analyze sentiment , it is well known that the overall semantic orientation of a sentence may differ from that of individual words ."
Research questions	This article investigates how semantic orientations can be better detected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall phrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our three main contributions are the following : ( a ) a human-annotated finance phrase bank that can be used for training and evaluating alternative models ; ( b ) a technique to enhance financial lexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events that affect sentiment ; and ( c ) a linearized phrase-structure model for detecting contextual semantic orientations in economic texts .
Research findings/conclusions	The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit of using the proposed learning algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative study against general sentiment models as well as the popular word frequency models used in recent financial studies .
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed framework is parsimonious and avoids the explosion in feature space caused by the use of conventional n-gram features .
Research questions	"Compared to the face-to-face communications , it can be particularly more challenging for users to understand and evaluate another 's perspective in online communications ."
Research questions	"On the other hand , the availability of the communication record in online communications offers a potential to leverage computational techniques to automatically detect user opinions and rationales ."
Research findings/conclusions	One promising approach to automatically detect the rationales is to detect the common discourse relations in rationale texts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , no empirical work has been done with regard to which discourse relations are commonly present in the users ' rationales in online communications ."
Research method	"To fill this gap , we annotated the discourse relations in the text segments that contain the rationales ( N = 527 text segments ) ."
Research method	These text segments are obtained from five datasets that consist of five online posts and the first 100 comments .
Research findings/conclusions	We identified 10 discourse relations that are commonly present in this sample .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our finding marks an important contribution to this rationale detection approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"We encourage more empirical work , preferably with a larger sample , to examine the generalizability of our Research findings/conclusions ."
Research questions	"Even though teaching is a mainstream , information-rich profession , teachers are understudied as information users ."
Research questions	"More specifically , not much is known about teacher personal information management ( PIM ) ."
Research questions	"Teacher PIM is critically important , as teachers navigate a complex information space complicated by the duality of digital and physical information streams and changing demands on instruction ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our research study increases understanding of teacher PIM and informs the development of tools to support educators .
Research questions	Some important unknowns exist about teachers as information users : What are teachers ' PIM practices ?
Research questions	What are the perceived consequences of these practices for teaching and learning ?
Research questions	How can PIM practices be facilitated to benefit teaching and learning ?
Research method	"This study employed a qualitative research design , with interviews from 24 primary and secondary teachers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We observed various systems for information organization , and teachers report their systems to be effective ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Important sources for teachers ' information in order of importance are personal collections , close colleagues , and the Internet ."
Research findings/conclusions	Key Research findings/conclusions reveal that inheriting and sharing information play an important part in information acquisition for teachers and that information technology supporting education creates unintentional demands on information management .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions on the nature of teacher information , teacher information finding , keeping , and organizational practices have important implications for teachers themselves , school principals , digital library developers , school librarians , curriculum developers , educational technology developers , and educational policy makers ."
Research method	We concentrated on the explanatory power of early attention on conference papers for citations collected from Google Scholar and Scopus .
Research findings/conclusions	The early attention data includes users ' online activities in a conference support system : CN3 .
Research method	"Bookmarks from the bibliographic management system , Citeulike , were used as a collateral source of early attention ."
Research method	"To examine the chronological contributions of 13 factors on citations , a multiple sequential regression analysis was conducted for three timepoints of the publication cycle-paper submission , time of conferences , and months after conferences ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results illustrate that online readers ' early attention of Citeulike bookmarks were found to have the most influence on the future impact of the conference papers .
Research findings/conclusions	The early attention records from CN3 made noteworthy improvements to explaining both the Google and Scopus citations as well .
Research findings/conclusions	"We also found that the type of papers the number of papers presented at a conference , and the best article award records were significant factors influencing future citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the magnitude of the effects made by online readers ' early attention from both sources appears to be larger than these three traditional factors ."
Research method	"A framework for understanding KC with hermeneutic phenomenology is developed , based on an analysis of recent KC research and key texts on hermeneutic phenomenology ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results obtained indicate that recent KC research still emphasizes the concept of knowledge as an asset inside the human mind , although the interest is in knowing and interpersonal relationships in working communities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Exploration of the use of the effect of interaction in research on KC shows that successful interaction is connected to the ideas of openness , critical thinking , and awareness of past experiences ."
Research findings/conclusions	These elements reflect the general ideas of the hermeneutic tradition without taking into account the historical roots of hermeneutics or questioning the concept of a human being behind them .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is concluded that the hermeneutic circle and phenomenological conceptualization of a human being provide a better defined and more coherent structure for understanding the event of KC as a future-oriented , conscious act of interaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The framework developed offers three fundamental areas for exploration : structure of the interactive event , construction of the human experience in interaction , and modes of being in interaction ."
Research method	"We analyzed 127,812 articles published between 1988 and 2013 in 173 journals on the ISI Web of Science in the management category ."
Research findings/conclusions	Collaboration occurred in approximately 60 % of all articles .
Research findings/conclusions	A power-law relationship was found between citation-based performance and journal size and collaboration patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	The number of citations expected by collaborative articles increases 2 ( 1.89 ) or 3.7 times when the number of collaborative articles published in a journal doubles .
Research findings/conclusions	The number of citations expected by noncollaborative articles only increases 2 ( 1.35 ) or 2.55 times if a journal publishes double the number of noncollaborative articles .
Research findings/conclusions	The Matthew effect is stronger for collaborative than for noncollaborative articles .
Research findings/conclusions	Scale-independent indicators increase the confidence in the evaluation of the impact of the articles published in management journals .
Research questions	"Literature suggests that if a person is information-related competent in one context , then he or she will be competent in the rest of the contexts of action ."
Research findings/conclusions	But this is only true for a basic level of information competencies .
Research findings/conclusions	"This article reports results from 24 interviews performed to mature e-learning students and suggests that in a more advanced level of information competencies , some competencies that appear in one context are not manifested in another context ."
Research findings/conclusions	Several factors have been found to be related with information competencies transfer between contexts .
Research findings/conclusions	Attitude is a key factor and feelings regarding Internet use is another critical factor .
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically in learning environments , the results suggest that canned content and planned learning strategies can discourage a proactive attitude and enthusiasm for information and communication technologies , and therefore the acquisition of information-related competencies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Understanding the differences and common patterns between these contexts may be useful for designing better information systems , services and instruction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the award of the Nobel Prize in 2005 affected not only the citations to his work , but also affected the citations to the references in his scientific oeuvre ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that the spillover effect is almost as powerful as the effect itself .
Research findings/conclusions	We are consequently able to document a ripple effect in which the awarding of the Nobel Prize ignites a citation chain reaction to Aumann 's scientific ouvre and to the references in its nearest citation network .
Research questions	The effect is discussed using innovation decision process theory as a point of departure to identify the factors that created a bandwagon effect leading to the reported observations .
Research questions	"In this exploratory study , we investigate how employees use and get value from a variety of social networking technologies ."
Research method	The context of this research is 4 software firms located in China .
Research findings/conclusions	"Notwithstanding differences in corporate attitudes toward social networking , we identify common themes in the way Web 2.0 technologies are leveraged as value is created by employees at all levels ."
Research method	We draw on the communication ecology framework to analyze the application of various technologies .
Research method	"We inductively develop 5 propositions that describe how social networking technologies contribute directly to horizontal and vertical communication in organizations , and ultimately to individual , team , and organizational performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for research and practice are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , existing general-Research questions social web sentiment analysis algorithms may not be optimal for texts focussed around specific topics ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article introduces 2 new methods , mood setting and lexicon extension , to improve the accuracy of topic-specific lexical sentiment strength detection for the social web ."
Research findings/conclusions	Mood setting allows the topic mood to determine the default polarity for ostensibly neutral expressive text .
Research method	Topic-specific lexicon extension involves adding topic-specific words to the default general sentiment lexicon .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments with 8 data sets show that both methods can improve sentiment analysis performance in corpora and are recommended when the topic focus is tightest .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study integrates online community with urban-rural health inequality in China to empirically explore whether online communities reduce health disparities between urban and rural areas in China .
Research method	"By collecting a unique data set from an online community in China that focuses on one disease , an exponential random graph model was used to empirically analyze the network structures and relationships formed in this community ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that technology-mediated online health communities can alleviate health disparities in China by exchanging information and improving the health capabilities of rural residents .
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss the implications and guidelines for future research .
Research findings/conclusions	Most Twitter search systems generally treat a Tweet as a plain text when modeling relevance .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , a series of conventions allows users to Tweet in structural ways using a combination of different blocks of texts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These blocks include plain texts , hashtags , links , mentions , etc ."
Research findings/conclusions	Each block encodes a variety of communicative intent and the sequence of these blocks captures changing discourse .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous work shows that exploiting the structural information can improve the structured documents ( e.g. , web pages ) retrieval ."
Research method	"In this study we utilize the structure of Tweets , induced by these blocks , for Twitter retrieval and Twitter opinion retrieval ."
Research method	"For Twitter retrieval , a set of features , derived from the blocks of text and their combinations , is used into a learning-to-rank scenario ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We show that structuring Tweets can achieve state-of-the-art performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our approach does not rely on social media features , but when we do add this additional information , performance improves significantly ."
Research questions	"For Twitter opinion retrieval , we explore the question of whether structural information derived from the body of Tweets and opinionatedness ratings of Tweets can improve performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results show that retrieval using a novel unsupervised opinionatedness feature based on structuring Tweets achieves comparable performance with a supervised method using manually tagged Tweets .
Research findings/conclusions	Topic-related specific structured Tweet sets are shown to help with query-dependent opinion retrieval .
Research questions	Our hypothesis is that named entities ( NEs ) are more informative than other features in the news when clustering fine grained topics .
Research findings/conclusions	"The algorithm does not need as input any information related to the number of clusters , and carries out the clustering only based on information regarding the shared named entities of the news items ."
Research method	"This proposal is evaluated using different data sets and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms , thereby proving the plausibility of the approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , because the applicability of our approach depends on the possibility of identifying equivalent named entities among the news , we propose a heuristic system to identify equivalent named entities in the same and different languages , thereby obtaining good performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This approach involves achieving informational privacy , through the features of anonymity and obscurity , through an optimal balance of ontological frictions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This approach may be used to modify models for information behavior and for information literacy , giving them a fuller and more effective coverage of privacy issues in the infosphere ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For information behavior , the Information Seeking and Communication Model and the Information Grounds conception are most appropriate for this Research questions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For information literacy , the metaliteracy model , using a modification a privacy literacy framework , is most suitable ."
Research findings/conclusions	An effective mechanism that provides high quality app recommendations becomes necessary .
Research questions	"However , existing recommendation techniques tend to recommend similar items but fail to consider users ' functional requirements , making them not effective in the app domain ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a recommendation architecture that can generate app recommendations at the functionality level ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We address the redundant recommendation problem in the app domain by highlighting users ' functional requirements , an element that has received scant attention from existing recommendation research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Another main feature of our work is extracting app functionalities from textural user reviews for recommendation .
Research questions	We also propose an effective approach for functionality extraction .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that our proposed AppRank method outperforms other commonly used recommendation methods .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , it doubles the recall value of the second best method under an extremely sparse setting , increases the overall ranking accuracy of the second best method by 14.27 % , and retains a high diversity of 0.99 ."
Research questions	"When dealing with user-generated text , the diverse and informal writing style makes traditional approaches much less effective ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , in many types of text on social media such as user comments , tweets , or question-answer posts , the contextual connections between documents do exist ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Examples include posts in a thread discussing the same topic , tweets that share a hashtag about the same entity ."
Research questions	Our idea in this work is utilizing the related contexts across documents to perform mention recognition in a collective manner .
Research findings/conclusions	"Intuitively , within a mention coreference graph , the labels of mentions are expected to propagate from more confidence cases to less confidence ones ."
Research questions	"To this end , we propose a novel semisupervised inference algorithm named parameterized label propagation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In our model , the propagation weights between mentions are learned by an attention-like mechanism , given their local contexts and the initial labels as input ."
Research method	We study the performance of our approach in the Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	"News data set , where comments and articles within a thread share similar context ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that our model significantly outperforms all other noncollective NER baselines .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that web technologies continue to drive developments , especially at the research front , although perhaps more indirectly than before ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A broadening of perspectives is visible in IS 2006-2010 , where network science becomes influential and where full-text analysis methods complement traditional computer science influences ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research in the areas of the h-index and mapping of science appears to have been highlights of IS 2006-2011 .
Research findings/conclusions	"This study tests and confirms a forecast made previously by comparing knowledge-base and research-front Research findings/conclusions for IS 2001-2005 , which expected both the information retrieval ( IR ) systems and webometrics specialties to shrink in 2006 to 2010 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A corresponding comparison of the knowledge base and research front of IS 2006-2010 suggests a continuing decline of the IR systems specialty in the near future , but also a considerable ( re ) growth of the webometrics area after a period of decline from 2001 to 2005 and 2006 to 2010 , with the latter due perhaps in part to its contribution to an emerging web science ."
Research method	"Taking a sociocultural approach , this article covers two main types of epistemology beyond the brain , namely , embodied epistemology and nonindividualist epistemology ."
Research method	"Using citizen science and music to illustrate related concepts of intuition , experience , and embodiment , this article describes intuition as a cultural system , beyond a purely individual possession ."
Research questions	"We describe howin cultural practices such as musicintuition acts as mediator between knowledge and embodiment , and intuition is built and modified by experience over time ."
Research questions	"Building on Dick 's ( ) notion of holistic perspectivism , we pose a holistic epistemology approach that embraces knowledge that extends well beyond the purely cognitive , in both embodied situations and systemic manifestations ."
Research questions	"As information research becomes increasingly interested in the role of the body and its relationship to information , knowledge , intuition , and memory , we argue that such an approach will uncover further dimensions of nonindividualist , systemic , and embodied knowledge ."
Research method	"In this article , we perform extensive analyses on a large-scale online video viewing log on smart TVs ."
Research questions	"Because time influences almost every aspect of our lives , our aim is to understand temporal patterns of the online video viewing behavior of smart TV viewers at the crowd level ."
Research method	"First , we measure the amount of time per hour spent in watching online videos on smart TV by each household on each day ."
Research method	"By applying clustering techniques , we identify eight daily patterns whose peak hours occur in different segments of the day ."
Research findings/conclusions	The differences among households can be characterized by three types of temporal habits .
Research findings/conclusions	We also uncover five periodic weekly patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	There seems to be a circadian rhythm at the crow level .
Research findings/conclusions	Further analysis confirms that there exists a holiday effect in the online video viewing behavior on smart TVs .
Research questions	"Finally , we investigate the popularity variations of different video categories over the day ."
Research findings/conclusions	The obtained insights shed light on how we can partition a day to improve the performance of time-aware video recommendations for smart TV viewers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Links between various data sources play a key role insofar as they allow software applications ( e.g. , browsers , search engines ) to operate over the aggregated data space as if it was a unique local database ."
Research method	"In this new data space , where DBpedia , a data set including structured information from Wikipedia , seems to be the central hub , we analyzed and highlighted outgoing links from this hub in an effort to discover broken links ."
Research method	The paper reports on an experiment to examine the causes of broken links and proposes some treatments for solving this problem .
Research method	We call this type of ontology a single-viewpoint ontology .
Research questions	There can be a variety of such single viewpoint ontologies that represent a wide spectrum of subfields and expert opinions on the domain .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , to have a complete formal vocabulary for the domain they need to be linked and unified into a multi-viewpoint model while having the subjective viewpoint statements marked and distinguished from the objectively true statements ."
Research method	"In this study , we propose and implement a two-phase methodology for multiviewpoint ontology construction by nonexpert users ."
Research method	The proposed methodology was implemented for the domain of the effect of diet on health .
Research method	"A large-scale crowdsourcing experiment was conducted with about 750 ontological statements to determine whether each of these statements is objectively true , viewpoint , or erroneous ."
Research method	"Typically , in crowdsourcing experiments the workers are asked for their personal opinions on the given subject ."
Research questions	"However , in our case their ability to objectively assess others ' opinions was examined as well ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show substantially higher accuracy in classification for the objective assessment approach compared to the results based on personal opinions .
Research method	"Initial repository development was focused on North America , Western Europe , and Australasia , particularly the United States , United Kingdom , Germany , and Australia , followed by Japan ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Since 2010 , there has been repository growth in East Asia , South America , and Eastern Europe , especially in Taiwan , Brazil , and Poland ."
Research findings/conclusions	"During the period , some countries , including France , Italy , and Spain , have maintained steady growth , whereas other countries , notably China and Russia , have experienced limited growth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Globally , repositories are predominantly institutional , multidisciplinary and English-language based ."
Research questions	They typically use open-source OAI-compliant software but have immature licensing arrangements .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the size of repositories is difficult to assess accurately , available data indicate that a small number of large repositories and a large number of small repositories make up the repository landscape ."
Research method	"These trends are analyzed using innovation diffusion theory , which is shown to provide a useful explanatory framework for repository adoption at global , national , organizational , and individual levels ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Major factors affecting both the initial development of repositories and their take-up include IT infrastructure , cultural factors , policy initiatives , awareness-raising activity , and usage mandates ."
Research findings/conclusions	Mandates are likely to be crucial in determining future repository development .
Research questions	"The study also compares the associations between the factors and uploading intentions of two different cultures , the United States and South Korea ."
Research method	"Using data from surveys of college students from the two countries ( n=249 and 173 ) , structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ego involvement not only plays an essential role in explaining uploading intention but also functions as an antecedent of attitude and perceived behavioral control in both countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the subjective norm was not significantly associated with uploading intention in either country , and the descriptive norm was a marginally significant factor in accounting for uploading intention in the United States ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , it was found that , only in the United States , attitude was significantly associated with uploading intention , whereas perceived behavioral control was a significant factor in explaining uploading intention in both countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions suggest that the effects of cultural differences , the impact of subjective norms in particular , may be weakened with the more self-oriented nature of Web 2.0 applications and social media such as Wikipedia ."
Research method	Theoretical implications are discussed .
Research method	"The semantic annotation system ( OPTIMA ) performs the tasks of Named Entity Recognition , Relation Extraction , Negation Detection , and Word-Sense Disambiguation using hand-crafted rules and terminological resources for associating contextual abstractions with classes of the standard ontology CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model ( CRM ) for cultural heritage and its archaeological extension , CRM-EH ."
Research method	Relation Extraction ( RE ) performance benefits from a syntactic-based definition of RE patterns derived from domain oriented corpus analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	"The evaluation also shows clear benefit in the use of assistive natural language processing ( NLP ) modules relating to Word-Sense Disambiguation , Negation Detection , and Noun Phrase Validation , together with controlled thesaurus expansion ."
Research findings/conclusions	The semantic indexing results demonstrate the capacity of rule-based Information Extraction techniques to deliver interoperable semantic abstractions ( semantic annotations ) with respect to the CIDOC CRM and archaeological thesauri .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Major contributions include recognition of relevant entities using shallow parsing NLP techniques driven by a complimentary use of ontological and terminological domain resources and empirical derivation of context-driven RE rules for the recognition of semantic relationships from phrases of unstructured text .
Research findings/conclusions	"F1000 recommends important publications in the biomedical literature , and from this perspective F1000 could be an interesting tool for research evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By linking the complete database of F1000 recommendations to the Web of Science bibliographic database , we are able to make a comprehensive comparison between F1000 recommendations and citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that about 2 % of the publications in the biomedical literature receive at least one F1000 recommendation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Recommended publications on average receive 1.30 recommendations , and more than 90 % of the recommendations are given within half a year after a publication has appeared ."
Research findings/conclusions	There turns out to be a clear correlation between F1000 recommendations and citations .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the correlation is relatively weak , at least weaker than the correlation between journal impact and citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	More research is needed to identify the main reasons for differences between recommendations and citations in assessing the impact of publications .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The genre structure and relationships among genre structure constituents shed new light on organizing information by Research questions or function .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study examines the relationships among a set of functional units previously constructed in a taxonomy , each of which is a chunk of information embedded in a document and is distinct in terms of its communicative function ."
Research method	"Through a card-sort study , relationships among functional units were identified with regard to their occurrence and function ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest that a group of functional units can be identified , collocated , and navigated by particular relationships ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Understanding how functional units are related to each other is significant in linking information pieces in documents to support finding , aggregating , and navigating information in a distributed information environment ."
Research questions	We argue that the notion of location as it manifests itself in location-based systems is being produced as an object of exchange .
Research questions	"Here we are specifically concerned with what happens to institutional roles , power relationships , and decision-making processes when a particular type of informationthat of spatiotemporal location of peopleis made into a technologically tradable object through the use of location-based systems ."
Research questions	"We examine the introduction of GPS ( Global Positioning Systems ) technologies by the California criminal justice system and the institution of parole for monitoring the movements of parolees , with consequences both for the everyday lives of these parolees and the work practices of their parole officers ."
Research questions	We document the ways in which broad adoption of location-based and mobile technologies has the capacity to radically reconfigure the spatiotemporal arrangement of institutional processes .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The presence of digital location traces creates new forms of institutional accountability , facilitates a shift in the understood relation between location and action , and necessitates new models of interpretation and sense making in practice ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It shows that doctoral students tend to cite more documents per article than faculty members , and that the literature they cite is , on average , more recent ."
Research findings/conclusions	It also demonstrates that doctoral students cite a larger proportion of conference proceedings and journal articles than faculty members and faculty members are more likely to self-cite and cite theses than doctoral students .
Research findings/conclusions	"Analysis of the impact of cited journals indicates that in health research , faculty members tend to cite journals with slightly lower impact factors whereas in social sciences and humanities , faculty members cite journals with higher impact factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , it provides evidence that , in every discipline , faculty members tend to cite a higher proportion of clinical/applied research journals than doctoral students ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study contributes to the understanding of referencing patterns and age stratification in academia .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for understanding the information-seeking behavior of academics are discussed .
Research method	The evolution of search algorithms ( based on the Web of Science and Web of Knowledge database platforms ) was used to show the impact of errors of omission and commission in the outcomes of scientometric research .
Research method	Optimization of the search algorithm led to the complete reassessment of previously published Research findings/conclusions on the performance of environmental tobacco smoke research .
Research findings/conclusions	"Instead of strong continuous growth , the field of environmental tobacco smoke research was shown to experience stagnation or slow growth since mid-1990s when evaluated quantitatively ."
Research findings/conclusions	Qualitative analysis revealed steady but slow increase in the citation rate and decrease in uncitedness .
Research findings/conclusions	"Country analysis revealed the North-European countries as leaders in environmental tobacco smoke research ( when the normalized results were evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively ) , whereas the United States ranked first only when assessing the total number of papers produced ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Scientometric research artifacts , including both errors of omission and commission , were shown to be capable of completely obscuring the real output of the chosen research field ."
Research findings/conclusions	This may leave out opportunities for making recommendations that analyze the search process and/or recommend alternative search process instead of objects .
Research questions	"To overcome this limitation , we investigated whether by analyzing a searcher 's current processes we could forecast his likelihood of achieving a certain level of success with respect to search performance in the future ."
Research method	We propose a machine-learning-based method to dynamically evaluate and predict search performance several time-steps ahead at each given time point of the search process during an exploratory search task .
Research method	Our prediction method uses a collection of features extracted from expression of information need and coverage of information .
Research method	"For testing , we used log data collected from 4 user studies that included 216 users ( 96 individuals and 60 pairs ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show 80-90 % accuracy in prediction depending on the number of time-steps ahead .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In effect , the work reported here provides a framework for evaluating search processes during exploratory search tasks and predicting search performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Importantly , the proposed approach is based on user processes and is independent of any IR system ."
Research method	"In this study , we used a multiscale framework to reduce the effects caused by noise and to extract explainable geometric properties to characterize finite metric spaces ."
Research method	"We conducted lab experiments that integrated the use of eye-tracking , electrodermal activity ( EDA ) , and user logs to explore users ' information-seeking behaviors on search engine result pages ( SERPs ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experimental results of 1,590 search queries showed that the proposed strategies effectively predicted query-level user satisfaction using EDA and eye-tracking data ."
Research findings/conclusions	The bootstrap analysis showed that combining EDA and eye-tracking data with user behavior data extracted from user logs led to a significantly better linear model fit than using user behavior data alone .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , cross-user and cross-task validations showed that our methods can be generalized to different search engine users performing different preassigned tasks ."
Research method	Study I explored the experiences of women striving to make sense of symptoms associated with menopause ; Study II examined posts from two online discussion groups for people with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder .
Research findings/conclusions	Joint data analysis demonstrates that normality was initially perceived as the absence of illness .
Research findings/conclusions	A breakdown in perceived normality because of disruptive symptoms created gaps and discontinuities in understanding .
Research findings/conclusions	"As participants interacted with information about the experiences of health-challenged peers , socially constructed notions of normality emerged ."
Research findings/conclusions	This was internalized as a new normal .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions demonstrate normality as an element of sense making that changes and develops over time , and experiential information and social contexts as central to health-related sense making ."
Research questions	"Re-establishing perceptions of normality , as experienced by health-challenged peers , was an important element of sense making ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This investigation provides nuanced insight into notions of normality , extends understanding of social processes involved in sense making , and represents the first theorizing of and model development for normality within the information science and sense making literature ."
Research questions	Various human evaluation techniques as well as automatic metrics have been proposed and investigated in the last decade .
Research questions	"However , very few evaluation methods take the linguistic aspect into account ."
Research method	"In this article , we use an objective evaluation method for machine translation output that classifies all translation errors into one of the five following linguistic levels : orthographic , morphological , lexical , semantic , and syntactic ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Linguistic guidelines for the target language are required , and human evaluators use them in to classify the output errors ."
Research method	The experiments are performed on English-to-Catalan and Spanish-to-Catalan translation outputs generated by four different systems : 2 rule-based and 2 statistical .
Research method	"All translations are evaluated using the 3 following methods : a standard human perceptual evaluation method , several widely used automatic metrics , and the human linguistic evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the linguistic , perceptual , and automatic results are then calculated , showing that the semantic level correlates significantly with both perceptual evaluation and automatic metrics ."
Research questions	"Some fields are well known for using alphabetic author order , while others put a great emphasis on the meaning of the author order and place authors according to contribution ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article is the first to use mixed method to examine the extent of alphabetic author order and to examine why researchers adopt a certain author order norm in the fields of economics and political science .
Research findings/conclusions	"The article finds that alphabetic authorship has been and is the norm in economics , while some tendency towards it exists in political science ."
Research findings/conclusions	The differences in the intellectual and social organization of the fields seem to be a factor in the extent that these researchers will adopt a certain norm .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the increasing number of authors per article and the publish-or-perish culture seems to put pressure on the alphabetic norm because it creates greater attention to the reputational advantages of being first-author ."
Research method	"Data regarding 4 aspects of their music-related psychological traits-music involvement , musical identity , preference diversity , and preference openness-were also collected through a background questionnaire ."
Research findings/conclusions	A classification of music access modes was proposed based on the circumstances that lead to a music listening experience .
Research findings/conclusions	A mixed regression analysis revealed several significant interaction effects between psychological traits and the mode of music access on music enjoyment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Foremost among these was a positive interaction effect between preference openness and the playing of a known track triggered by musical cues , and that between preference diversity and exposure to new music played by others ."
Research findings/conclusions	Individuals with a strong musical identity tended to enjoy music played of their own volition without any apparent triggers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , a multimodal logistic regression analysis also revealed the relationships between these psychological traits and the likelihood of different music access modes ."
Research findings/conclusions	Preference diversity significantly increased the likelihood of music listening triggered by need arousal .
Research findings/conclusions	The results support the proposition that users ' music-related psychological traits should be considered in personalized recommendation strategies .
Research method	This article investigates the relationship between changes in the share of the world 's scientific output and changes in relative citation impact for 2.6 million articles from 26 fields in the 25 countries with the most Scopus-indexed journal articles from 1996 to 2015 .
Research findings/conclusions	"There is a negative correlation between expansion and relative citation impact , but their relationship varies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"China , Spain , Australia , and Poland were successful overall across the 26 fields , expanding both their share of the world 's output and its relative citation impact , whereas Japan , France , Sweden , and Israel had decreased shares and relative citation impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , the USA , UK , Germany , Italy , Russia , The Netherlands , Switzerland , Finland , and Denmark all enjoyed increased relative citation impact despite a declining share of publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , India , South Korea , Brazil , Taiwan , and Turkey all experienced sustained expansion but a recent fall in relative citation impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	These results may partly reflect changes in the coverage of Scopus and the selection of fields .
Research questions	"Numerous bibliometric indices have been proposed for the ranking of research performance , mainly on an ad hoc basis ."
Research questions	We introduce the novel class of Scientific Research Measures ( SRMs ) to rank scientists ' research performance and provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for these measures .
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast to many bibliometric indices , SRMs take into account the whole citation curve of the scientist , offer appealing structural properties , allow a finer ranking of scientists , correspond to specific features of different disciplines , research areas and seniorities , and include several bibliometric indices as special cases ."
Research findings/conclusions	Thus SRMs result in more accurate rankings than ad hoc bibliometric indices .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We also introduce the further general class of Dual SRMs that reflect the value of journals and permit the ranking of research institutions based on theoretically sound criteria , which has been a central theme in the scientific community over recent decades ."
Research findings/conclusions	An empirical application to the citation curves of 173 finance scholars shows that SRMs can be easily calibrated to actual citation curves and generate different authors ' rankings than those produced by seven traditional bibliometric indices .
Research questions	What is the reason behind whether a university places higher or lower in the ranking ?
Research questions	"Taking the example of ETH Zurich , the aim of this communication is to reconstruct how the high position of ETHZ ( in Europe rank no ."
Research findings/conclusions	"1 in PP [ top 10 % ] ) in the Centre for Science and Technology Studies ( CWTS ) Leiden Ranking 2013 in the field social sciences , arts and humanities came about ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to our analyses , the bibliometric indicator values of a university depend very strongly on weights that result in differing estimates of both the total number of a university 's publications and the number of publications with a citation impact in the 90th percentile , or PP ( top 10 % ) ."
Research questions	"In addition , we examine the effect of weights at the level of individual publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the results , we offer recommendations for improving the Leiden Ranking ( for example , publication of sample calculations to increase transparency ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This implies that disambiguation approaches might be improved if ethnic name groups are distinguished before disambiguation .
Research method	We explore the potential of ethnic name partitioning by comparing performance of four machine learning algorithms trained and tested on the entire data or specifically on individual name groups .
Research findings/conclusions	Results show that ethnicity-based name partitioning can substantially improve disambiguation performance because the individual models are better suited for their respective name group .
Research findings/conclusions	The improvements occur across all ethnic name groups with different magnitudes .
Research findings/conclusions	Performance gains in predicting matched name pairs outweigh losses in predicting nonmatched pairs .
Research findings/conclusions	"Feature ( e.g. , coauthor name ) similarities of name pairs vary across ethnic name groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	Such differences may enable the development of ethnicity-specific feature weights to improve prediction for specific ethic name categories .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions are observed for three labeled data with a natural distribution of problem sizes as well as one in which all ethnic name groups are controlled for the same sizes of ambiguous names .
Research findings/conclusions	This study is expected to motive scholars to group author names based on ethnicity prior to disambiguation .
Research method	"For this Research questions , a theoretical approach is applied that comprises the analytical notion of material objects and a document theory ."
Research method	"Empirical material was primarily ethnographically produced over a period of 6 months , including 2 seminars within the network ."
Research questions	"Trajectories of sharing that reach across time and space have been identified by studying how people interact with multidimensional objects , such as documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	These were found to coordinate and shape the social practice under study .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The theoretical framework has made it possible to highlight aspects of information sharing that have tended to be blackboxed in previous research .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It has been suggested in previous research that the concept of information sharing can be reduced to that of mere sharing .
Research findings/conclusions	Such a stance potentially entails reduction of conceptual ambiguity but may also decrease analytical sharpness .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the present study , it appears beneficial to adopt the concept of document into the discourse of information-sharing research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By adding the concept of document to our analytical toolbox , which hitherto has been dominated by the slightly diffuse concept of information , material features can be emphasized without reducing the social and cognitive dimensions of information sharing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The article offers insight into the information-sharing activities of design researchers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Through its focus on materiality , it presents a novel theoretical approach and methodological strategy for studying information practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We showcase the set of developed language-dependent and language-independent features , the model of training examples , consisting of pairs of equal features for known and unknown texts , and the appropriate method of authorship verification ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An authorship verification accuracy greater than 90 % was accomplished via the application of stylometric methods on four different languages ( English , Greek , Spanish , and Dutch , while the verification for Dutch is slightly lower ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the multilingual case , the highest authorship verification accuracy using basic machine-learning methods , over 90 % , was achieved by the application of the kNN and SVM-SMO methods , using the feature selection method SVM-RFE ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The improvement in authorship verification accuracy in multilingual cases , over 94 % , was accomplished via ensemble learning methods , with the MultiboostAB method being a bit more accurate , but Random Forest is generally more appropriate ."
Research questions	But inclusivity within this online encyclopedia is not a simple matter of just allowing anyone to contribute .
Research questions	"In its quest for legitimacy as an encyclopedia , Wikipedia relies on outsiders to judge claims championed by rival editors ."
Research method	"In choosing these experts , Wikipedians define the boundaries of acceptable comment on any given subject ."
Research findings/conclusions	Inclusivity then becomes a matter of how the boundaries of expertise are drawn .
Research questions	In this article I examine the nature of these boundaries and the implications they have for inclusivity and credibility as revealed through the talk pages produced and sources used by a particular subset of Wikipedia 's creatorsthose involved in writing articles on the topic of Philippine history .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications , with 15 % -24 % of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrated on the most recent publications , although their presence is increasing over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Publications from the social sciences , humanities , and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics , indicating their potential value and interest for these fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is relatively weak , thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Altmetric scores ( particularly mentions in blogs ) are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores ( JCS ) , but they have a lower level of recall ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted , although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , it is unclear how users identify the most satisfying reply ."
Research method	"Based on the dual-process theory of knowledge adoption , we developed a conceptual model and empirical method to study which factors influence adoption of a reply ."
Research method	"We extracted 6 variables for argument quality ( Ease of understanding , Relevance , Completeness , Objectivity , Timeliness , Structure ) and 4 for source credibility ( Physician 's online experience , Physician 's offline expertise , Hospital location , Hospital level ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The empirical results indicate that both central and peripheral routes affect user 's adoption of a response .
Research findings/conclusions	"Physician 's offline expertise negatively affects user 's adoption decision , while physician 's online experience positively affects it ; this effect is positively moderated by user involvement ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the method may negatively impact the retrieval performance when some irrelevant terms are used in the expanded query ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , it is necessary to refine the expansion terms ."
Research questions	"Learning to rank methods have proven effective in information retrieval to solve ranking problems by ranking the most relevant documents at the top of the returned list , but few attempts have been made to employ learning to rank methods for term refinement in pseudo relevance feedback ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes a novel framework to explore the feasibility of using learning to rank to optimize pseudo relevance feedback by means of reranking the candidate expansion terms .
Research findings/conclusions	We investigate some learning approaches to choose the candidate terms and introduce some state-of-the-art learning to rank methods to refine the expansion terms .
Research questions	"In addition , we propose two term labeling strategies and examine the usefulness of various term features to optimize the framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results with three TREC collections show that our framework can effectively improve retrieval performance .
Research method	"In this paper , we conduct a comprehensive and in-depth bibliometric analysis of the field of bioinformatics by extracting citation data from PubMed Central full-text ."
Research method	"Citation data for the period 2000 to 2011 , comprising 20,869 papers with 546,245 citations , was used to evaluate the productivity and influence of this emerging field ."
Research method	"Four measures were used to identify productivity ; most productive authors , most productive countries , most productive organizations , and most popular subject terms ."
Research method	"Research impact was analyzed based on the measures of most cited papers , most cited authors , emerging stars , and leading organizations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show the overall trends between the periods 2000 to 2003 and 2004 to 2007 were dissimilar , while trends between the periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011 were similar ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the field of bioinformatics has undergone a significant shift , co-evolving with other biomedical disciplines ."
Research method	Twenty students engaged in making projects of their choice with low- and high-technologies for 15 weeks .
Research method	"Data collection included visual process mapping activities , surveys , and Dervin 's Sense-Making Methodology-informed interviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions included inspirations , actions , emotions , challenges , helps , and learning that occurred during the making processes ."
Research findings/conclusions	Information played an integral role as students engaged in creative production and learning .
Research findings/conclusions	"Students identified information as helps , challenges , how they learn , and learning outcomes ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The study proposes a new , evolving process model of making that illustrates production-centered information behavior and learning ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The model 's spiral form emphasizes the non-linear and cyclical nature of the making process .
Research findings/conclusions	Squiggly lines represent how the making process is gap-filled and uncertain .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study contributes to the scholarly and professional fields of information science , library and information studies , maker , and STEAM ( Science , Technology , Engineering , Art , and Math ) learning ."
Research questions	"To fill this gap , this article assesses whether a number of simple metrics derived from Amazon.com reviews of academic books could provide evidence of their impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on a set of 2,739 academic monographs from 2008 and a set of 1,305 best-selling books in 15 Amazon.com academic subject categories , the existence of significant but low or moderate correlations between citations and numbers of reviews , combined with other evidence , suggests that online book reviews tend to reflect the wider popularity of a book rather than its academic impact , although there are substantial disciplinary differences ."
Research findings/conclusions	Metrics based on online reviews are therefore recommended for the evaluation of books that aim at a wide audience inside or outside academia when it is important to capture the broader impacts of educational or cultural activities and when they can not be manipulated in advance of the evaluation .
Research questions	Such tasks are challenging because searchers must keep track of their search progress and the information they encounter across sessions .
Research questions	Multi-session tasks can be cognitively taxing for visually impaired users because the lack of persistence of screen readers causes the load on working memory to be high .
Research questions	"In this article , we first discuss the habitual behavior of visually impaired participants for multi-session tasks when using popular search interfaces ."
Research method	We then present the evaluation of a search interface developed to support complex information seeking for visually impaired users .
Research method	The user evaluation was structured in two sessions to simulate a multi-session task .
Research questions	"Thus , we discuss the strategies observed among participants to resume the search , to review previously encountered information , and to satisfy their evolved information need ."
Research questions	We also compare the information-seeking behavior across the two sessions and examine how the proposed interface supports participants for multi-session tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions from this evaluation contribute to our understanding of the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users and have implications for the design of tools to support searchers to manage and make sense of information during multi-session search tasks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Burrell ( 2013 ) showed that efforts to derive formulae from the mathematical framework of Lotkaian informetrics could lead to misleading results .
Research questions	"On this note , we argue that a simple heuristic thermodynamical model can enable a better three-dimensional ( 3D ) evaluation of the information production process leading to what we call the zynergy-index ."
Research questions	"Due to this trend , researchers in various disciplines have become interested in studying relationships between real-world phenomena and their virtual representations ."
Research questions	One such area of emerging research seeks to study relationships between real-world and virtual activism of social movement organization ( SMOs ) .
Research questions	"In particular , SMOs holding extreme social perspectives are often studied due to their tendency to have robust virtual presences to circumvent real-world social barriers preventing information dissemination ."
Research questions	"However , many previous studies have been limited in scope because they utilize manual data-collection and analysis methods ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	They also often have failed to consider the real-world aspects of groups that partake in virtual activism .
Research method	We utilize automated data-collection and analysis methods to identify significant relationships between aspects of SMO virtual communities and their respective real-world locations and ideological perspectives .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results also demonstrate that the interconnectedness of SMO virtual communities is affected specifically by aspects of the real world .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These observations provide insight into the behaviors of SMOs within virtual environments , suggesting that the virtual communities of SMOs are strongly affected by aspects of the real world ."
Research method	We explore the range of factors motivating and impacting individuals ' happy information-sharing behavior within a casual leisure context through 30 semistructured interviews .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions reveal that the factors influencing individuals ' happy information-sharing behavior are numerous , and impact each other ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most individuals considered sharing happy information important to their friendships and relationships .
Research findings/conclusions	In various contexts the act of sharing happy information was shown to enhance the sharer 's happiness .
Research questions	The benefits of PHRs and barriers preventing their adoption are also widely discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"These issues are affected by technology infrastructure , and current and planned technology infrastructure deployment will be key determinants in the selection and design of PHR architectures ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Assumptions about the community-wide deployment of required technologies such as hardware and internet accessibility are implicit in the architectural selection of PHRs and these dependencies have not been fully appreciated or addressed in the existing literature .
Research method	This review article introduces and describes two infrastructural driversubiquitous technology baseline for PHRs and connectivity coverageand examines their inter-relationships with the selected PHR architectures .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Eleven functional capabilities are also described , providing a basis for the analysis of the relationships between the two infrastructural drivers and architectural selection ."
Research questions	"Designing digital information environments to support serendipity can not only provide users with new knowledge , but also propel them in directions they might not otherwise have traveled insurprising and delighting them along the way ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As serendipity involves unexpected circumstances it can not be directly controlled , but it can be potentially influenced ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has focused on providing a rich empirical understanding of how it might be influenced ."
Research method	We interviewed 14 creative professionals to identify their self-reported strategies aimed at increasing the likelihood of serendipity .
Research findings/conclusions	These strategies form a framework for examining ways existing digital environments support serendipity and for considering how future environments can create opportunities for it .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This is a new way of thinking about how to design for serendipity ; by supporting the strategies found to increase its likelihood rather than attempting to support serendipity as a discrete phenomenon , digital environments not only have the potential to help users experience serendipity but also encourage them to adopt the strategies necessary to experience it more often ."
Research questions	"We argue that in prior network analyses of coauthorship networks , the information on ordering has been insufficiently considered because ties between authors are typically symmetrized ."
Research findings/conclusions	This is basically the same as assuming that each coauthor has contributed equally to a paper .
Research findings/conclusions	"We introduce a solution to this problem by adopting a coauthorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and Diesner ( 2014 ) , which in its core conceptualizes coauthoring as a directed , weighted , and self-looped network ."
Research method	We test and validate our application of the adopted framework based on a sample data of 861 authors who have published in the journal Psychometrika .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The results suggest that this novel sociometric approach can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand insights into coauthoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among scholars .
Research method	"As another form of validation , we also show how our approach accurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated with the journal ."
Research method	It uses a citation data set of Scopus-indexed journals and proceedings .
Research method	The journal-level citation data set is aggregated into 27 subject areas and these subjects are selected as the unit of analysis .
Research method	A 3-step approach is employed : the first step examines disciplines ' citation characteristics through scientific trading dimensions ; the second step analyzes citation flows between pairs of disciplines ; and the third step uses egocentric citation networks to assess individual disciplines ' citation flow diversity through Shannon entropy .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that measured by scientific impact , the subjects of Chemical Engineering , Energy , and Environmental Science have the fastest growth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , most subjects are carrying out more diversified knowledge trading practices by importing higher volumes of knowledge from a greater number of subjects ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study also finds that the growth rates of disciplinary citations align with the growth rates of global research and development ( R & D ) expenditures , thus providing evidence to support the impact of R & D expenditures on knowledge production ."
Research questions	"Although the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable , citations from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to study disciplinary knowledge flow ."
Research method	This study constructs a knowledge-flow network in which a node represents a Journal Citation Reports subject category and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another .
Research method	"Using the concept of shortest path , several quantitative measurements are proposed and applied to a knowledge-flow network ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on an examination of subject categories in Journal Citation Reports , this study indicates that social science domains tend to be more self-contained , so it is more difficult for knowledge from other domains to flow into them ; at the same time , knowledge from science domains , such as biomedicine- , chemistry- , and physics-related domains , can access and be accessed by other domains more easily ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study also shows that social science domains are more disunified than science domains , because three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain to another require at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by providing empirical analysis .
Research questions	"Finding and indexing visual material to assist the process of ideation often fall on the designer , leading to user experiences that are less than ideal ."
Research method	"To inform development of computer systems to assist graphic designers in the ideation phase of the design process , we conducted interviews with 15 professional graphic designers about their design process and visual information needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the study , we propose a set of requirements for an ideation-support system for graphic design ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We criticize the h-index from a theoretical point of view .
Research questions	"We argue that for the Research questions of measuring the overall scientific impact of a scientist ( or some other unit of analysis ) , the h-index behaves in a counterintuitive way ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In certain cases , the mechanism used by the h-index to aggregate publication and citation statistics into a single number leads to inconsistencies in the way in which scientists are ranked ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our conclusion is that the h-index can not be considered an appropriate indicator of a scientist 's overall scientific impact .
Research method	"Based on recent theoretical insights , we discuss what kind of indicators can be used as an alternative to the h-index ."
Research findings/conclusions	We pay special attention to the highly cited publications indicator .
Research findings/conclusions	"This indicator has a lot in common with the h-index , but unlike the h-index it does not produce inconsistent rankings ."
Research method	We conducted a study in which 30 people browsed and selected content within an online news website .
Research method	"Data collected included psychometric scales ( User Engagement , Cognitive Absorption , System Usability Scales ) , self-reported interest in news content , and performance metrics ( i.e. , reading time , browsing time , total time , number of pages visited , and use of recommended links ) ; a subset of the participants had their physiological responses recorded during the interaction ( i.e. , heart rate , electrodermal activity , electrocmytogram ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions demonstrated the concurrent validity of the psychometric scales and interest ratings and revealed that increased time on tasks , number of pages visited , and use of recommended links were not necessarily indicative of greater self-reported engagement , cognitive absorption , or perceived usability ."
Research findings/conclusions	Positive ratings of news content were associated with lower physiological activity .
Research findings/conclusions	The implications of this research are twofold .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , we propose that user experience is a useful framework for studying online information interactions and will result in a broader conceptualization of information interaction and its evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we advocate a mixed-methods approach to measurement that employs a suite of metrics capable of capturing the pragmatic ( e.g. , usability ) and hedonic ( e.g. , fun , engagement ) aspects of information interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We underscore the importance of using multiple measures in information research , because our results emphasize that performance and physiological data must be interpreted in the context of users ' subjective experiences ."
Research questions	"Being attributed to the original 140-character length , Twitter provides its users with quick-posting and easy-forwarding features that facilitate the timely dissemination of warnings and alerts ."
Research questions	"However , a concern arises with respect to the terseness of tweets that restricts the amount of information conveyed in a tweet and thus increases a tweet & apos ; s uncertainty ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We tackle such concerns by proposing entropy as a measure for a tweet & apos ; s uncertainty .
Research questions	"Based on the perspectives of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ( URT ) , we theorize that the more uncertain information of a disaster tweet , the higher the entropy , which will lead to a lower retweet count ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By leveraging the statistical and predictive analyses , we provide evidence supporting that entropy validly and reliably assesses the uncertainty of a tweet ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study contributes to improving our understanding of information propagation on Twitter during disasters .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Academically , we offer a new variable of entropy to measure a tweet & apos ; s uncertainty , an important factor influencing disaster tweets & apos ; retweeting ."
Research findings/conclusions	Entropy plays a critical role to better comprehend URLs and emoticons as a means to convey information .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Practically , this research suggests a set of guidelines for effectively crafting disaster messages on Twitter ."
Research questions	"What , precisely , is meant by this term , sharing economy ?"
Research questions	"The literature to date offers many , often incomplete and conflicting definitions ."
Research questions	"This makes it difficult for researchers to lead a coherent discourse , to compare Research findings/conclusions and to select appropriate cases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Alternative terms ( e.g. , collaborative consumption , gig economy , and access economy ) are a further complication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To resolve this issue , our article develops a consolidated ( based on all prior work ) and systemic ( relating to the phenomenon in its entire scope ) definition of the sharing economy ."
Research method	The definition is based on the detailed analysis of definitions and explanations in 152 sources identified in a systematic literature review .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We identify 36 original understandings of the term sharing economy .
Research method	"Using semantic integration strategies , we consolidate 84 semantic facets in these definitions into 18 characteristics of the sharing economy ."
Research questions	"Resolving conflicts in the meaning and scope of these characteristics , we arrive at a consolidated , systemic definition ."
Research method	We evaluate the definition 's appropriateness and applicability by applying it to cases claimed by the media to be examples of the sharing economy .
Research findings/conclusions	This article 's definition is useful for future research and discourse on the sharing economy .
Research method	"We conducted our experiments on 8 benchmark data sets , and computed Spearman correlations between the outputs of our methods and the ground truth ."
Research method	We report our results together with 3 state-of-the-art approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art approaches in all the selected English benchmark data sets .
Research questions	"In particular , the increasing use of the web for health information prompts us to reexamine our existing delivery mechanisms ."
Research method	"We present enquireMe , which is a contextual question answering system that provides lay users with the ability to obtain responses about a wide range of health topics by vaguely expressing at the start and gradually refining their information needs over the course of an interaction session using natural language ."
Research findings/conclusions	"enquireMe allows the users to engage in conversations about their health concerns , a process that can be therapeutic in itself ."
Research method	The system uses community-driven question-answer pairs from the web together with a decay model to deliver the top scoring answers as responses to the users ' unrestricted inputs .
Research method	We evaluated enquireMe using benchmark data from WebMD and TREC to assess the accuracy of system-generated answers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the absence of complex knowledge acquisition and deep language processing , enquireMe is comparable to the state-of-the-art question answering systems such as START as well as those interactive systems from TREC ."
Research method	"It models the total cost of publicationcomprising costs of journal subscriptions , OA article-processing charges ( APCs ) , and new administrative costs-for a sample of 24 institutions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"APCs are shown to constitute 12 % of the total cost of publication , APC administration , 1 % , and subscriptions , 87 % ( for a sample of seven publishers ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	APC expenditure in institutions rose between 2012 and 2014 at the same time as rising subscription costs .
Research findings/conclusions	There was disproportionately high take up of Gold options for Health and Life Sciences articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"APC prices paid varied widely , with a mean APC of 1,586 pound in 2014 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hybrid options ( subscription journals also offering OA for individual articles on payment of an APC ) were considerably more expensive than fully OA titles , but the data indicate a correlation between APC price and journal quality ( as reflected in the citation rates of journals ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The policy implications of these developments are explored , particularly in relation to hybrid OA and potential of offsetting subscription and APC costs ."
Research method	Most researchers used RIMSs to discover research content .
Research findings/conclusions	Fewer used RIMSs for sharing and promoting their research .
Research findings/conclusions	Early career researchers were more frequent users of RIMSs than were associate and full professors .
Research findings/conclusions	"Likewise , assistant professors and postdocs exhibited a higher probability of using RIMSs to promote their research than did students and full professors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Humanities researchers were the least frequent users of RIMSs .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , humanities scholars used RIMSs to evaluate research less than did scholars in other disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The tasks of discovering papers , monitoring the literature , identifying potential collaborators , and promoting research were predictors of higher RIMS use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Researchers who engaged in promoting their research , evaluating research , or monitoring the literature showed a greater propensity to have a public RIMS profile ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , researchers mostly agreed that not being required , having no effect on their status , not being useful , or not being a norm were reasons for not having a public RIMS profile ."
Research findings/conclusions	Humanities scholars were also more likely than social scientists to agree that having a RIMS profile was not a norm in their fields .
Research method	"Grounded on singular value decomposition , the model represents terms and documents by the distribution signatures of their statistical contribution across the top-ranking latent concept dimensions ."
Research method	LSISSM matches term signatures with document signatures according to their mapping coherence between latent semantic indexing ( LSI ) term subspace and LSI document subspace .
Research findings/conclusions	LSISSM does feature reduction and finds a low-rank approximation of scalable and sparse term-document matrices .
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of major clustering algorithms such as standard K-means and self-organizing maps compared with the vector space model and the traditional LSI model .
Research findings/conclusions	"The unique contribution ranking mechanism in LSISSM also improves the initialization of standard K-means compared with random seeding procedure , which sometimes causes low efficiency and effectiveness of clustering ."
Research findings/conclusions	A two-stage initialization strategy based on LSISSM significantly reduces the running time of standard K-means procedures .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Theoretical contributions to knowledge organization and decision making are stressed .
Research method	We chose to work with a type of methodology known as multiple criteria decision making-Saaty 's analytical hierarchies process ( AHP ) .
Research method	This made it possible to develop a detailed analysis of the decision-making process and arrive at a hierarchical model .
Research findings/conclusions	"The model provided a structure representing the studied field , where an order of priority could be given to the decision-making process ."
Research findings/conclusions	The knowledge derived may be used in other fields of study such as information retrieval and knowledge representation .
Research findings/conclusions	Each group may require task-related knowledge of different topic domains and documents to accomplish its tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	Document recommendation methods are very useful to resolve the information overload problem and proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs .
Research questions	A worker 's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow ( KF ) to represent the evolution of his information needs over time .
Research questions	"However , the information needs of workers and groups may change over time , so that modeling the knowledge referencing behavior of a group of workers is difficult ."
Research questions	"Additionally , most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers ' KFs , or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge ."
Research questions	"In this work , I integrate the KF mining method and propose group-based recommendation methods , including group-based collaborative filtering ( GCF ) and group content-based filtering ( GCBF ) , to actively provide task-related documents for groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results show that the proposed methods have better performance than the personalized recommendation methods in recommending the needed documents for groups .
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , the recommended documents can fulfill the groups ' task needs and facilitate knowledge sharing among groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	This presentation can be used to detect and describe different paradigmatic types of reception speed for scientific journals .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"They offer easily accessible platforms for users to seek , receive , and provide supports by posting ."
Research method	"Taking the advantage of text mining and machine learning techniques , we identified social support type ( s ) in each post and a new user 's support needs in an OHC ."
Research method	We examined a user 's first-time support-seeking experience by measuring both quantity and quality of received support .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results revealed that the amount and match of received support are positive and significant predictors of new users ' continued engagement .
Research findings/conclusions	Our outcomes can provide insight for designing and managing a sustainable OHC by retaining users .
Research questions	"Traditional approaches for discovering publication outlets mainly focus on manually matching research relevance in terms of keywords as well as comparing journal qualities , but other research-relevant information such as social connections , publication rewards , and productivity of authors are largely ignored ."
Research questions	"To assist in identifying effective publication outlets and to support effective journal recommendations for manuscripts , a three-dimensional profile-boosted research analytics framework ( RAF ) that holistically considers relevance , connectivity , and productivity is proposed ."
Research method	"To demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework , a prototype system was implemented using the ScholarMate research social network platform ."
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results show that the proposed RAF-based approach outperforms traditional recommendation techniques that can be applied to journal recommendations in terms of quality and performance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research is the first attempt to provide an integrated framework for effective recommendation in the context of scientific item recommendation .
Research questions	Investor opinions extracted from online investment communities capture crowd wisdom and have begun to play an important role in financial markets .
Research questions	"Existing research confirms the importance of crowd wisdom in stock predictions , but fails to investigate factors influencing crowd performance ( that is , crowd prediction accuracy ) ."
Research questions	"In order to help improve crowd performance , our research strives to investigate the impact of crowd characteristics on crowd performance ."
Research method	"We conduct an empirical study using a large data set collected from a popular online investment community , StockTwits ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions show that experience diversity , participant independence , and network decentralization are all positively related to crowd performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , crowd size moderates the influence of crowd characteristics on crowd performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"From a theoretical perspective , our work enriches extant literature by empirically testing the relationship between crowd characteristics and crowd performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From a practical perspective , our Research findings/conclusions help investors better evaluate social sensors embedded in user-generated stock predictions , based upon which they can make better investment decisions ."
Research questions	"To absorb salient content from the vast bulk of microblog posts , this article focuses on the task of microblog keyphrase extraction ."
Research questions	"In previous work , most efforts treat messages as independent documents and might suffer from the data sparsity problem exhibited in short and informal microblog posts ."
Research questions	"On the contrary , we propose to enrich contexts via exploiting conversations initialized by target posts and formed by their replies , which are generally centered around relevant topics to the target posts and therefore helpful for keyphrase identification ."
Research method	"Concretely , we present a neural keyphrase extraction framework , which has 2 modules : a conversation context encoder and a keyphrase tagger ."
Research method	"The conversation context encoder captures indicative representation from their conversation contexts and feeds the representation into the keyphrase tagger , and the keyphrase tagger extracts salient words from target posts ."
Research method	The 2 modules were trained jointly to optimize the conversation context encoding and keyphrase extraction processes .
Research method	"In the conversation context encoder , we leverage hierarchical structures to capture the word-level indicative representation and message-level indicative representation hierarchically ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In both of the modules , we apply character-level representations , which enables the model to explore morphological features and deal with the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by the informal language style of microblog messages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive comparison results on real-life data sets indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models from previous studies .
Research method	"In order to fill this gap , we conducted a large-scale user survey questioning various aspects of people 's music information needs and behaviors ."
Research questions	"In particular , we investigated if general music users ' needs and behaviors have significantly changed over time by comparing our current survey results with a similar survey conducted in 2004 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this paper , we present the key Research findings/conclusions from the survey data and discuss 4 emergent themes- ( a ) the shift in access and use of personal music collections ; ( b ) the growing need for tools to support collaborative music seeking , listening , and sharing ; ( c ) the importance of visual music experiences ; and ( d ) the need for ontologies for providing rich contextual information ."
Research questions	We conclude by making specific recommendations for improving the design of MIR systems and services .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although previous studies focus on knowledge contribution quantity , this study regards quantity and quality as two important , yet distinct , aspects of knowledge contribution ."
Research questions	"Drawing on self-determination theory , this study proposes that five motivational factors , categorized along the extrinsic-intrinsic spectrum of motivation , have differential effects on knowledge contribution quantity versus quality in the context of online Q & A communities ."
Research method	An online survey with 367 participants was conducted in a leading online Q & A community to test the research model .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that rewards in the reputation system , learning , knowledge self-efficacy , and enjoy helping stand out as important motivations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , rewards in the reputation system , as a manifestation of the external regulation , is more effective in facilitating the knowledge contribution quantity than quality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Knowledge self-efficacy , as a manifestation of intrinsic motivation , is more strongly related to knowledge contribution quality , whereas the other intrinsic motivation , enjoy helping , is more strongly associated with knowledge contribution quantity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed .
Research questions	Little is known about how the increasing variety of available metrics affects researchers ' processes of selecting literature to read .
Research method	"We conducted ranking experiments embedded into an online survey with 247 participating researchers , most from social sciences ."
Research method	"Participants completed series of tasks in which they were asked to rank fictitious publications regarding their expected relevance , based on their scores regarding six prototypical metrics ."
Research method	"Through applying logistic regression , cluster analysis , and manual coding of survey answers , we obtained detailed data on how prominent metrics for research impact influence our participants in decisions about which scientific articles to read ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Survey answers revealed a combination of qualitative and quantitative characteristics that researchers consult when selecting literature , while regression analysis showed that among quantitative metrics , citation counts tend to be of highest concern , followed by Journal Impact Factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results suggest a comparatively favorable view of many researchers on bibliometrics and widespread skepticism toward altmetrics .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions underline the importance of equipping researchers with solid knowledge about specific metrics ' limitations , as they seem to play significant roles in researchers ' everyday relevance assessments ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article enhances our understanding of successive information searches by employing an experimental method to observe whether and how the behavioral characteristics of searchers statistically significantly changed over sessions .
Research questions	"It focuses on a specific type of successive search called transmuting successive searches , in which searchers learn about and gradually refine their information problems during the course of the information search ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that searchers ' behavioral characteristics indeed exhibit different patterns in different sessions .
Research findings/conclusions	The identification of the behavioral characteristics can help information retrieval systems to detect stages or sessions of the information search process .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The Research findings/conclusions also help validate a theoretical framework to explain successive searches and suggest system requirements for supporting the associated search behavior .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study is one of the first to not only test for statistical significance among research propositions concerning successive searches but to also apply the research principles of implicit relevance feedback to successive searches .
Research findings/conclusions	"Seven search roles , representing distinct behavior patterns displayed by children when interacting with the Google search engine , are described , including Developing Searchers , Domain-specific Searchers , Power Searchers , Nonmotivated Searchers , Distracted Searchers , Rule-bound Searchers , and Visual Searchers ."
Research method	Other trends are described and selected to present a view of the whole child searcher .
Research findings/conclusions	"These roles and trends are used to make recommendations to designers , researchers , educators , and parents about the directions to take when considering how to best aid children to become search literate ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most science mapping studies use a single method .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , as research fields have various properties , a valid map of a field should actually be composed of a set of maps derived from a series of investigations using different methods ."
Research questions	That leads to the question of what can be learned from a combination-triangulation-of these different science maps .
Research method	"In this paper we propose a method for triangulation , using the example of water science ."
Research method	"We combine three different mapping approaches : journal-journal citation relations ( JJCR ) , shared author keywords ( SAK ) , and title word-cited reference co-occurrence ( TWRC ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results demonstrate that triangulation of JJCR , SAK , and TWRC produces a more comprehensive picture than each method applied individually ."
Research findings/conclusions	The outcomes from the three different approaches can be associated with each other and systematically interpreted to provide insights into the complex multidisciplinary structure of the field of water research .
Research method	"We examined the effect of social information ( i.e. , tweets ) on the accuracy of the generated summaries by comparing the user preference for TBS ( tweet-biased summary ) with GS ( generic summary ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The result of crowdsourcing-based evaluation shows that the user preference for TBS was significantly higher than GS .
Research method	"We also took random samples of the documents to see the performance of summaries in a traditional evaluation using ROUGE , which , in general , TBS was also shown to be better than GS ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We further analyzed the influence of the number of tweets pointed to a web document on summarization accuracy , finding a positive moderate correlation between the number of tweets pointed to a web document and the performance of generated TBS as measured by user preference ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that incorporating social information into the summary generation process can improve the accuracy of summary .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The reason for people choosing one summary over another in a crowdsourcing-based evaluation is also presented in this article .
Research method	"Using nearly 1 million articles , and three classification systems with different levels of granularity , we study the effects of number of cited references , share of references covered by Web of Science , mean age of references and mean citation rate of references on field normalized citation rate ."
Research method	"To expose the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable , we use quantile regression ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that a higher number of references , a higher share of references to publications within Web of Science and references to more recent publications correlate with citation impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	A correlation was observed even when normalization was done with a finely grained classification system .
Research findings/conclusions	The predictor variables affected citation impact to a larger extent at higher quantile levels .
Research findings/conclusions	"Regarding the relative importance of the predictor variables , citation impact of the cited references was in general the least important variable ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Number of cited references carried most of the importance for both low and medium quantile levels , but this importance was lessened at the highest considered level ."
Research questions	One of the core issues in medical information retrieval ( IR ) is diversity of tasks that lead to diversity of categories of information needs and queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"From the evaluation perspective , another related and challenging issue is the limited availability of appropriate test collections allowing the experimental validation of medically task oriented IR techniques and systems ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we explore the peculiarities of TREC and CLEF medically oriented tasks and queries through the analysis of the differences and the similarities between queries across tasks , with respect to length , specificity , and clarity features and then study their effect on retrieval performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that , even for expert oriented queries , language specificity level varies significantly across tasks as well as search difficulty ."
Research findings/conclusions	Additional Research findings/conclusions highlight that query clarity factors are task dependent and that query terms specificity based on domain-specific terminology resources is not significantly linked to term rareness in the document collection .
Research findings/conclusions	The lessons learned from our study could serve as starting points for the design of future task-based medical information retrieval frameworks .
Research method	"These were assessed in relation to previous research undertaken linking information behavior and experience with paradigm , metatheory , and discourse ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research assesses how the epistemic concept is treated , both within information science and within disciplines that have affinities to the topics or agents that have been the subject of inquiry within the field ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	An attempt is made to clarify the types of connections that are associated with the epistemic concept and to provide a clearer view of how research focused on information behavior might consider the questions underpinning assumptions relating to knowledge and knowing .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The symbiotic connection between epistemics and information science is advanced as a suitably nuanced conception of socially organized knowledge from which to define the appropriate level at which knowledge claims can be usefully advanced .
Research findings/conclusions	It is proposed that fostering a better understanding of epistemics as a research practice might also provide for the development of a range of insights and methods that reflect the dynamic context within which the study of information behavior and information experience is located .
Research method	"Given the limitations on searching Twitter 's public application programming interface ( API ) , we used the Topsy search engine as a source for compiling tweets ."
Research method	"To this end , we took a global sample of 200 universities and compiled all the tweets with hyperlinks to any of these institutions ."
Research method	Further link data was obtained from alternative sources ( MajesticSEO and OpenSiteExplorer ) in order to compare the results .
Research method	"Thereafter , various statistical tests were performed to determine the correlation between the indicators and the possibility of predicting external links from the collected tweets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate a high volume of tweets , although they are skewed by the performance of specific universities and countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The data provided by Topsy correlated significantly with all link indicators , particularly with OpenSiteExplorer ( r=0.769 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , prediction models do not provide optimum results because of high error rates ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that the use of Twitter ( via Topsy ) as a source of hyperlinks to universities produces promising results due to its high correlation with link indicators , though limited by policies and culture regarding use and presence in social networks ."
Research method	All single authors from two econometrics journals over a 10-year time period form the basis of the analysis of how experience and prestige affect the number of references in their publications .
Research findings/conclusions	Preliminary results from linear regression models suggest that two author types can be characterized using this analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	Review experience seems to be the decisive factor in the data .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The article discusses the implications of the Research findings/conclusions and offers suggestions for future research within this new and promising area .
Research findings/conclusions	"These different areas of knowledge have different restrictions on use of vocabulary ; thesauri are used only in information search and retrieval contexts , whereas lexicons are mental systems and generally applicable in all domains of life ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A set of vocabulary requirements that defines the more concrete characteristics of vocabulary items in the 2 contexts can be derived from this framework : lexicon items have to be learnable , complex , transparent , etc. , whereas thesaurus terms must be effective , current and relevant , searchable , etc ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The differences in vocabulary properties correlate with 2 other factors , the well-known dimension of Control ( deliberate , social activities of building and maintaining vocabularies ) , and Syntagmatization , which is less known and describes vocabulary items ' varying formal preparedness to exit the thesaurus/lexicon , enter into linear syntactic constructions , and , finally , acquire communicative functionality ."
Research method	It is proposed that there is an inverse relationship between Control and Syntagmatization .
Research questions	"Satisfaction with the data reuse experience , however , has not been widely studied ."
Research method	"Drawing from the information systems and information science literature , we developed a model to examine the relationship between data quality and data reusers ' satisfaction ."
Research method	"Based on a survey of 1,480 journal article authors who cited Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research ( ICPSR ) data in published papers from 2008-2012 , we found several data quality attributes-completeness , accessibility , ease of operation , and credibility-had significant positive associations with data reusers ' satisfaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	There was also a significant positive relationship between documentation quality and data reusers ' satisfaction .
Research findings/conclusions	"This share was repeatedly reported to exceed 10 % of the total papers produced , without any explanation of this phenomenon and the lack of difference in uncitedness between average and successful researchers ."
Research method	"In this report , we analyze the uncitedness among two independent groups of highly visible scientists ( mathematicians represented by Fields medalists , and researchers in physiology or medicine represented by Nobel Prize laureates in the respective field ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Analysis of both groups led to the identical conclusion : over 90 % of the uncited database records of highly visible scientists can be explained by the inclusion of editorial materials progress reports presented at international meetings ( meeting abstracts ) , discussion items ( letters to the editor , discussion ) , personalia ( biographic items ) , and by errors of omission and commission of the Web of Science ( WoS ) database and of the citing documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Only a marginal amount of original articles and reviews were found to be uncited ( 0.9 and 0.3 % , respectively ) , which is in strong contrast with the previously reported data , which never addressed the document types among the uncited records ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous work has reported descriptive statistics about these scientists ' information-seeking behavior .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study extends that work to examine relationships between scientists ' information-seeking behaviors and their personal and environmental factors .
Research method	"Several regression models , including the Poisson model , the logit model , and the ordered logit model , are built to interpret the correlation among scientists ' behaviors ."
Research method	"In addition , exploratory factor analysis is used for data reduction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , many factors were found to affect the specific information-seeking behaviors of scientists , including demographic , psychological , role-related , and environmental factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Of the factors having an effect , academic position was the most important determinant of information behavior ."
Research questions	"As the number of new scientific publications arrives at a rate that rapidly outpaces our capacity of reading , analyzing , and synthesizing scientific knowledge , we need to augment ourselves with information that can effectively guide us through the rapidly growing intellectual space ."
Research questions	"In this article , we address a fundamental issue concerning what kinds of information may serve as early signs of potentially valuable ideas ."
Research questions	"In particular , we are interested in information that is routinely available and derivable upon the publication of a scientific paper without assuming the availability of additional information such as its usage and citations ."
Research method	We propose a theoretical and computational model that predicts the potential of a scientific publication in terms of the degree to which it alters the intellectual structure of the state of the art .
Research method	The structural variation approach focuses on the novel boundary-spanning connections introduced by a new article to the intellectual space .
Research findings/conclusions	"We validate the role of boundary-spanning in predicting future citations using three metrics of structural variation-namely , modularity change rate , cluster linkage , and Centrality Divergence-along with more commonly studied predictors of citations such as the number of coauthors , the number of cited references , and the number of pages ."
Research method	Main effects of these factors are estimated for five cases using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models of citation counts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Key Research findings/conclusions indicate that ( a ) structural variations measured by cluster linkage are a better predictor of citation counts than are the more commonly studied variables such as the number of references cited , ( b ) the number of coauthors and the number of references are both good predictors of global citation counts to a lesser extent , and ( c ) the Centrality Divergence metric is potentially valuable for detecting boundary-spanning activities at interdisciplinary levels ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The structural variation approach offers a new way to monitor and discern the potential of newly published papers in context .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The boundary-spanning mechanism offers a conceptually simplified and unifying explanation of the roles played by commonly studied extrinsic properties of a publication in the study of citation behavior .
Research questions	"To apply search tactics in the information retrieval ( IR ) processes , users make decisions and take actions in the search process , while IR systems assist them by providing different system features ."
Research findings/conclusions	After analyzing 61 participants ' information searching diaries and questionnaires we identified various types of user involvement and system support in applying different types of search tactics .
Research method	"Based on quantitative analysis , search tactics were classified into 3 groups : user-dominated , system-dominated , and balanced tactics ."
Research findings/conclusions	We further explored types of user involvement and types of system support in applying search tactics from the 3 groups .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions show that users and systems play major roles in applying user-dominated and system-dominated tactics , respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When applying balanced tactics , users and systems must collaborate closely with each other ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a model that illustrates user involvement and system support as they occur in user-dominated tactics , system-dominated tactics , and balanced tactics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most important , IR system design implications are discussed to facilitate effective and efficient applications of the 3 groups of search tactics ."
Research method	"In this article , we introduce a gold-standard dataset of software mentions from the manual annotation of 4,971 academic PDFs in biomedicine and economics ."
Research findings/conclusions	The dataset is intended to be used for automatic extraction of software mentions from PDF format research publications by supervised learning at scale .
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide a description of the dataset and an extended discussion of its creation process , including improved text conversion of academic PDFs ."
Research questions	"Finally , we reflect on our challenges and lessons learned during the dataset creation , in hope of encouraging more discussion about creating datasets for machine learning use ."
Research findings/conclusions	Many approaches operate in two steps .
Research method	"Themes are first identified from the set , and then a summary is formed by extracting salient sentences within the different documents of each of the identified themes ."
Research questions	"Among these approaches , latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) based approaches rely on spectral decomposition techniques to identify the themes ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a major extension of these techniques that relies on the quantum information access ( QIA ) framework ."
Research method	The latter is a framework developed for modeling information access based on the probabilistic formalism of quantum physics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The QIA framework not only points out the limitations of the current LSA-based approaches , but motivates a new principled criterium to tackle multidocument summarization that addresses these limitations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As a byproduct , it also provides a way to enhance the LSA-based approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Extensive experiments on the DUC 2005 , 2006 and 2007 datasets show that the proposed approach consistently improves over both the LSA-based approaches and the systems that competed in the yearly DUC competitions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This demonstrates the potential impact of quantum-inspired approaches to information access in general , and of the QIA framework in particular ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While this view provides a profound understanding of how people seek , use , and access information , it often overlooks the larger structure of the information landscapes that shape people 's information access ."
Research questions	"However , theorizing the information landscape of a local community at the community level is challenging because of the diverse contexts and users ."
Research findings/conclusions	One way to minimize the complexity is to focus on the materiality of information .
Research findings/conclusions	"By highlighting the material aspects of information , it becomes possible to understand the community-level structure of local information ."
Research questions	This paper develops a theory of local information landscapes ( LIL theory ) to conceptualize the material structure of local information .
Research questions	"LIL theory adapts a concept of the virtual as an ontological view of the local information that is embedded in technical infrastructures , spaces , and people ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By complementing existing theories , this paper provides a new perspective on how information deserts manifest as a material pre-condition of information inequality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these theoretical models , a research agenda is presented for future studies of local communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Three simple examples are presented , in which the indicators fluctuate strongly and the ranking of scientists in the evaluated group is sometimes completely mixed up by minor changes in the database ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The erratic behavior is traced to the specific way in which weights are attributed to the six percentile rank classes , specifically for the tied papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For 100 percentile rank classes , the effects will be less serious ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the six classes , it is demonstrated that a different way of assigning weights avoids these problems , although the nonlinearity of the weights for the different percentile rank classes can still lead to ( much less frequent ) changes in the ranking ."
Research findings/conclusions	This behavior is not undesired because it can be used to correct for differences in citation behavior in different fields .
Research findings/conclusions	"Remaining deviations from the theoretical value R ( 6 , k ) ? = ? 1.91 can be avoided by a new scoring rule : the fractional scoring ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previously proposed consistency criteria are amended by another property of strict independence at which a performance indicator should aim .
Research questions	A plethora of consumer health information products and services exist to inform people with hypertension and to promote self-management among them .
Research findings/conclusions	"Promotion of information sharing by African-American women represents a promising , culturally applicable strategy for consumer health information services focused on hypertension self-management ."
Research questions	Yet how African-American women share hypertension information with others is unclear .
Research questions	"The Research questions of this qualitative , descriptive study was to examine practices of information sharing in African-American women with hypertension ."
Research method	"Thirteen women ( mean age=73 , SD=9.87 ) participated in one of 2 focus groups held at an urban community health center ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thematic analysis revealed that the women shared information about how they self-managed their blood pressure i ) with female family members and friends , ii ) about ways in which they adapted self-management strategies to work for them , iii ) mostly in group settings , and iv ) because they wanted to prevent others from suffering and reinforce their own knowledge about hypertension self-management ."
Research findings/conclusions	New Research findings/conclusions emerged regarding assessing readiness for information .
Research findings/conclusions	Study Research findings/conclusions will be used to inform the design of an information-sharing intervention to support self-management of hypertension in African-American women .
Research questions	"Yet , typing even short queries becomes tedious on ever shrinking ( virtual ) keyboards ."
Research questions	"Meanwhile , speech processing is maturing rapidly , facilitating everyday language input ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , wearable technology can inform users proactively by listening in on their conversations or processing their social media interactions ."
Research questions	"Given these developments , everyday language may soon become the new input of choice ."
Research method	We present an information retrieval ( IR ) algorithm specifically designed to accept everyday language .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It integrates two paradigms of information retrieval , previously studied in isolation ; one directed mainly at the surface structure of language , the other primarily at the underlying meaning ."
Research method	"The integration was achieved by a Markov machine that encodes meaning by its transition graph , and surface structure by the language it generates ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A rigorous evaluation of the approach showed , first , that it can compete with the quality of existing language models , second , that it is more effective the more verbose the input , and third , as a consequence , that it is promising for an imminent transition from keyword input , where the onus is on the user to formulate concise queries , to a modality where users can express more freely , more informal , and more natural their need for information in everyday language ."
Research method	"To achieve this objective , the citation network of seven selected metrics and their information environment is analyzed ."
Research questions	"Citation networks are important in studying knowledge flows ; however , citation network analysis has primarily focused on binary networks in which the individual citation influences of each cited paper in a citing paper are considered identical , even though not all cited papers have a significant influence on the cited publication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Accordingly , it is necessary to build and analyze a citation network comprising scholarly publications that notably impact one another , thus identifying topic evolution in a more precise manner ."
Research method	"To measure the strength of citation influence and identify paper topics , we employ a citation influence topic model primarily based on topical inheritance between cited and citing papers ."
Research method	"Using scholarly publications in the field of the protein p53 as a case study , we build a citation network , filter it using citation influence values , and examine the diffusion of topics not only in the field but also in the subfields of p53 ."
Research questions	"Similar discussions happen on the interpretation of social scientific research data , for which information triangulation has been proposed as a useful method ."
Research questions	"In this article , we explore a design theoryconsisting of a kernel theory , meta-requirements , and meta-designsfor software and services that triangulate Internet information ."
Research method	The kernel theory identifies 5 triangulation methods based on Churchman 's inquiring systems theory and related meta-requirements .
Research method	These meta-requirements are used to search for existing software and services that contain design features for Internet information triangulation tools .
Research method	We discuss a prototyping study of the use of an information triangulator among 72 college students and how their use contributes to their opinion formation .
Research findings/conclusions	"From these Research findings/conclusions , we conclude that triangulation tools can contribute to opinion formation by information consumers , especially when the tool is not a mere fact checker but includes the search and delivery of alternative views ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we discuss other empirical propositions and design propositions for an agenda for triangulator developers and researchers ."
Research questions	"In particular , we propose investment in theory triangulation , that is , tools to automatically detect ethically and theoretically alternative information and views ."
Research questions	"However , information differs from physical objects by being intangible and easy-to-copy ."
Research questions	"Information as an experience good is inherently challenging to evaluate a priori ; therefore , comparing value before and after different types of experience is likely to inform theory about users ' preferences regarding information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Prior research mostly refers to consuming information and rarely considers the experience of producing information as a factor affecting information value .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The current research compares the effect of experiencing online information through production and consumption processes on value perception .
Research method	"In a set of 6 experiments with 178 participants , willingness-to-pay by consumers and willingness-to-accept payment by producers are measured before and after consumption and production of information , independently and as repeated measures ."
Research method	"In the experiments , we define and implement a framework for an information production process ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the value of information is dynamic .
Research findings/conclusions	"Value perception increased after experiencing information , especially when people engaged in producing information compared to consuming it ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study offers a window toward the practical design of new digital information products .
Research findings/conclusions	"Previous works and expert assessment recommend the adoption of an inclusive definition , with the aim of including all relevant uses of waste within this study ."
Research method	"An ad-hoc designed capture strategy has been used to retrieve WR-related peer-reviewed journal papers from selected databases , and the information contained in their author keyword field has been thoroughly cleaned ."
Research method	"Author keyword co-occurrence data have been used for building a similarity measure between keywords , plus cluster analysis for revealing the main WR research being addressed by the scientific community ."
Research method	Results have been further analyzed using advanced visualization tools to determine which clusters formed strongly-linked research areas that could set the main cognitive divisions of WR science .
Research method	"This process has been repeated with 2002 and 2012 data , and science maps reflecting the main research areas and clusters have been generated ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that WR mainly deals with the recovery of basic , widely used raw materials like water and fertile soil ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Energy generation and waste management are other relevant fields that show an interesting evolution , revealing signs of growth in research , together with the emergence of sub-areas reflecting consolidating research specialties ."
Research method	We analyze the authors ' use of graphs in this context in relation to the quality of these journals as measured by their 2-year impact factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"We note a substantial variability in the use of graphs in this context : For one journal , 100 % of the papers include graphs , whereas for others only about 50 % of them include graphs ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also show that higher impact agricultural journals publish more papers with graphs and that there are more graphs in these papers than in those in journals with lower impact factors ( r = +0.40 ) .
Research questions	We use rhetorical structure theory ( RST ) as the analytic framework to identify systematic differences between deceptive and truthful stories in terms of their coherence and structure .
Research method	"A sample of 36 elicited personal stories , self-ranked as truthful or deceptive , is manually analyzed by assigning RST discourse relations among each story 's constituent parts ."
Research method	A vector space model ( VSM ) assesses each story 's position in multidimensional RST space with respect to its distance from truthful and deceptive centers as measures of the story 's level of deception and truthfulness .
Research method	"Ten human judges evaluate independently whether each story is deceptive and assign their confidence levels ( 360 evaluations total ) , producing measures of the expected human ability to recognize deception ."
Research method	"As a robustness check , a test sample of 18 truthful stories ( with 180 additional evaluations ) is used to determine the reliability of our RST-VSM method in determining deception ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The contribution is in demonstration of the discourse structure analysis as a significant method for automated deception detection and an effective complement to lexicosemantic analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	The potential is in developing novel discourse-based tools to alert information users to potential deception in computer-mediated texts .
Research questions	"However , such contests stir up controversy among scholars and practitioners about the role of transparency , or more specifically , the unrestricted access and observability of the applications submitted throughout the contest ."
Research questions	"In one view , transparency may reduce performance because it causes excessive replication , whereas another view argues that transparency can encourage novel forms of reuse , namely recombination ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes a new perspective towards transparency as a design choice in open data contest architectures .
Research method	"We introduce a 2-dimensional view towards transparency , defined as observability of information about each submitted ( a ) solution ( how it works ) and its ( b ) performance ( how high it scores ) ."
Research method	"We design a sociotechnical contest architecture that jointly affords both transparency dimensions , and evaluate it in the field during a 21-day contest involving 28 participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that the joint instantiation of both transparency dimensions increases performance by triggering different kinds of recombination .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions advance literature on sociotechnical architectures for civic design .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , they guide practitioners in implementing open data contests and balancing the tension between individual versus collective benefits ."
Research method	"In traditional PRF methods , top-ranked documents are all assumed to be relevant and therefore treated equally in the feedback process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the performance gain brought by each document is different as showed in our preliminary experiments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , it is more reasonable to predict the performance gain brought by each candidate feedback document in the process of PRF ."
Research method	We define the quality level ( QL ) and then use this information to adjust the weights of feedback terms in these documents .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike previous work , we do not make any explicit relevance assumption and we go beyond just selecting good documents for PRF ."
Research method	"We propose a quality-based PRF framework , in which two quality-based assumptions are introduced ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Particularly , two different strategies , relevance-based QL ( RelPRF ) and improvement-based QL ( ImpPRF ) are presented to estimate the QL of each feedback document ."
Research method	"Based on this , we select a set of heterogeneous document-level features and apply a learning approach to evaluate the QL of each feedback document ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive experiments on standard TREC ( Text REtrieval Conference ) test collections show that our proposed model performs robustly and outperforms strong baselines significantly .
Research method	We propose a new architecture based on introducing an interlingual loss as an additional training objective .
Research findings/conclusions	"By adding and forcing this interlingual loss , we can train multiple encoders and decoders for each language , sharing among them a common intermediate representation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Translation results on the low-resource tasks ( Turkish-English and Kazakh-English tasks ) show a BLEU improvement of up to 2.8 points .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , results on a larger dataset ( Russian-English and Kazakh-English ) show BLEU losses of a similar amount ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While our system provides improvements only for the low-resource tasks in terms of translation quality , our system is capable of quickly deploying new language pairs without the need to retrain the rest of the system , which may be a game changer in some situations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , what is most relevant regarding our architecture is that it is capable of : reducing the number of production systems , with respect to the number of languages , from quadratic to linear ; incrementally adding a new language to the system without retraining the languages already there ; and allowing for translations from the new language to all the others present in the system ."
Research method	The research questions addressed are the following : ( a ) How do answer quality and answer speed vary across question types ?
Research questions	( b ) How do the relationships between answer quality and answer speed vary across question types ?
Research questions	( c ) How do the best quality answers and the fastest answers differ in terms of answer quality and answer speed across question types ?
Research method	( d ) How do trends in answer quality vary over time across question types ?
Research method	"From the posting of 3,000 questions in six CQAs , 5,356 answers were harvested and analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There was a significant difference in answer quality and answer speed across question types , and there were generally no significant relationships between answer quality and answer speed ."
Research findings/conclusions	The best quality answers had better overall answer quality than the fastest answers but generally took longer to arrive .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , although the trend in answer quality had been mostly random across all question types , the quality of answers appeared to improve gradually when given time ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By highlighting the subtle nuances in answer quality and answer speed across question types , this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted ."
Research method	Seven reference librarians tested a set of protocols to determine whether it was possible to use the types and foci of the questions extracted from customer requests submitted to the National Library of Medicine to find authoritative answers to these questions .
Research method	Librarians tested the protocols manually to determine if the process was sufficiently robust and accurate to later automate .
Research findings/conclusions	Results indicated that the extracted terms provide enough information to find authoritative answers for about 60 % of questions and that certain question types are more likely to result in authoritative answers than others .
Research findings/conclusions	"The question corpus and analysis performed for this project will inform automatic question answering systems , and could lead to suggestions for new content to include in MedlinePlus ."
Research findings/conclusions	This approach can serve as an example to researchers interested in methods of evaluating question answering tools and the contents of online databases .
Research questions	"These systems allow users to associate geolocation information with their images , which is essential for many interesting applications ."
Research questions	"However , only a small fraction of social images have geolocation information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Thus , an automated tool for suggesting geolocation is essential to help users geotag their images ."
Research method	"In this article , we use a large data set consisting of 221 million Flickr images uploaded by 2.2 million users ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"For the first time , we analyze user uploading patterns , user geotagging behaviors , and the relationship between the taken-time gap and the geographical distance between two images from the same user ."
Research method	"Based on the Research findings/conclusions , we represent a user profile by historical tags for the user and build a multinomial model on the user profile for geotagging ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We further propose a unified framework to suggest geolocations for images , which combines the information from both image tags and the user profile ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experimental results show that for images uploaded by users who have never done geotagging , our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 10.6 to 34.2 % , depending on the granularity of the prediction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For images from users who have done geotagging , a simple method is able to achieve very high accuracy ."
Research method	We employ a manual human-coding approach to classify book reviews in the field of history based on reviewers ' assessments of a book author 's scholarly credibility ( SC ) and writing style ( WS ) .
Research method	"In total , 100 book reviews were selected from the American Historical Review and coded for their positive/negative valence on these two dimensions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Most were coded as positive ( 68 % for SC and 47 % for WS ) , and there was also a small positive correlation between SC and WS ( r=0.2 ) ."
Research method	"We then constructed a classifier , combining both manual design and machine learning , to categorize sentiment-based sentences in history book reviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	The machine classifier produced a matched accuracy ( matched to the human coding ) of approximately 75 % for SC and 64 % for WS .
Research findings/conclusions	WS was found to be more difficult to classify by machine than SC because of the reviewers ' use of more subtle language .
Research findings/conclusions	"With further training data , a machine-learning approach could be useful for automatically classifying a large number of history book reviews at once ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Weighted megacitations can be especially valuable if they are used in conjunction with regular book/journal citations , and libcitations ( i.e. , library holding counts ) for a comprehensive assessment of a book/monograph 's scholarly impact ."
Research method	This article explores the new search option by scoring 50 top economics and finance journals and comparing them with the results obtained using the original Google Scholar-based search option .
Research findings/conclusions	"The new database delivers significantly smaller scores for all metrics , but the rank correlations across the two databases for the h-index , g-index , AWCR , and e-index are significantly correlated , especially when the time frame is restricted to more recent years ."
Research method	"Comparisons are also made to the Article Influence score from eigenfactor.org and to the RePEc h-index , both of which adjust for journal-level self-citations ."
Research method	We present an ethnographic study involving 156 hours of observation and 28 patient interviews in outpatient hemodialysis facilities .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using an extended Semiotic Framework for Information Systems Research , the Research findings/conclusions show that objects , spaces , and bodies were integral to 6 sociomaterial layers of facility information environments : the physical , empiric , syntactic , semantic , pragmatic , and social world ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Objects of importance in the information environments included dialysis machines , instruments , records , paper documents , televisions , furniture , thermostats , lighting , and personal possessions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Spatial features , including compartmentalization , displays , distance , proximity , and spatially-grounded routines , also constituted information environments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The information environments were also shaped by patient immobility , bodily discomforts , and orientation to bodily states ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Each sociomaterial layer introduced enablers and constraints to information access , flow , and acceptance ; these combined to construct patients primarily as passive recipients of information rather than active seekers and producers of information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A sociomaterial perspective and related focus on objects , spaces , and bodies offers a lens for professional information practice ."
Research findings/conclusions	We contribute information environment design guidance to facilitate such practice and stress that the value of certain sources and types of information can be materially encoded in an environment .
Research findings/conclusions	"By conducting a thematic analysis of the 25 UN commissioned reports and policy documents , this research identifies 14 broad cultural heritage information themes that need to be practiced in order to achieve cultural sustainability , of which information platforms , information sharing , information broadcast , information quality , information usage training , information access , information collection , and contribution appear to be the significant themes ."
Research method	An investigation of education on cultural heritage informatics and digital humanities at iSchools ( ) using a gap analysis framework demonstrates the core information science skills required for cultural heritage education .
Research findings/conclusions	"The research demonstrates that : ( i ) a thematic analysis of cultural heritage policy documents can be used to explore the key themes for cultural informatics education and research that can lead to sustainable development ; and ( ii ) cultural heritage information education should cover a series of skills that can be categorized in five key areas , viz. , information , technology , leadership , application , and people and user skills ."
Research method	"On the basis of in-depth interviews with and on-site observations of 24 scientists and a follow-up focus group interview in the field of bioscience/nanoscience and technology in Korea , we examined scientific collaboration using the framework of the scientific research life cycle ."
Research questions	"We attempt to explain the major motivations , characteristics of communication and information sharing , and barriers associated with scientists ' research collaboration practices throughout the research life cycle ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors , the timing of collaboration formation , partner selection , communication methods , information-sharing practices , and barriers at each phase of the life cycle ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases .
Research findings/conclusions	"The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process , not only in the beginning phase of the cycle ."
Research questions	"For communication and information-sharing practices , scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Barriers to collaboration throughout the phases included different priorities , competitive tensions , and a hierarchical culture among collaborators , whereas credit sharing was a barrier in the research product phase ."
Research questions	In this paper we propose several metrics to describe different facets of open access and open research .
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss measures to represent the public availability of articles along with their archival location , licenses , access costs , and supporting information ."
Research method	Calculations illustrating these new metrics are presented using the authors ' publications .
Research questions	We argue that explicit measurement of openness is necessary for a holistic description of research outputs .
Research questions	"Common ways of presenting such information include lists , maps , and augmented reality ( AR ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Each of these interface types has its strengths and weaknesses , but few empirical evaluations have been conducted to compare them in terms of performance and perceptions of usability ."
Research method	"In this paper , we investigate these issues using three interface types for searching and browsing location-based information across two task types : open and closed ended ."
Research method	The experimental study involved 180 participants who were issued an Android mobile phone preloaded with a specific interface and asked to perform a set of open- and closed-ended tasks using both searching and browsing approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that the list interface performed best across all tasks in terms of completion times , whereas the AR interface ranked second and the map interface performed worst ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants rated the list as best across most usability constructs but the map was rated better than the AR interface , even though the latter performed better ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications of the work are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , for its proper functioning , it is also preferable that a team be socially cohesive ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A team recommendation system , which facilitates the search for potential team members , can be of great help both for ( a ) individuals who need to seek out collaborators and for ( b ) managers who need to build a team for some specific tasks ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Such a decision support system that readily helps summarize multiple metrics indicating a team ( and its members ) quality , and possibly rank the teams in a personalized manner according to the end users ' preferences , thus serves as a tool to cope with what would otherwise be an information avalanche ."
Research method	"In this work , we present Social Web Application for Team Recommendation , a general-Research questions framework to compose various information retrieval and social graph mining and visualization subsystems together to build a composite team recommendation system , and instantiate it for a case study of academic teams ."
Research questions	Various methods have been proposed with a focus on comparing unstructured text documents .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Several of these have been enhanced with ontology ; however , they have not been applied to ontology instances ."
Research questions	"With the growth in ontology instance data published online through , for example , Linked Open Data , there is an increasing need to apply semantic similarity to ontology instances ."
Research questions	"Drawing on ontology-supported polarity mining ( OSPM ) , we propose an algorithm that enhances the computation of semantic similarity with polarity mining techniques ."
Research method	The algorithm is evaluated with online customer review data .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm in multiple settings .
Research questions	"Consumer health information behavior ( CHIB ) , which encompasses people 's healthrelated information needs as well as the ways in which they interact ( or do not interact ) with health-related information , plays an important role in people 's ability to prevent , cope with , and successfully manage a serious chronic disease across time ."
Research method	"In this mixed-method longitudinal study , the CHIB of 34 people with type 2 diabetes is explored with the goal of identifying the factors that motivate , demotivate , or impede their diabetes-related information seeking and use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions reveal that while these processes can be motivated by many different factors and can lead to important benefits , there are significant barriers ( such as incognizance , defined herein as having an information need that one is not aware of ) that may demotivate or impede information seeking and use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The implications of these Research findings/conclusions are discussed , focusing on how we might work toward preventing , identifying , and addressing incognizance among this population , ensuring they have the information they need when it can be of the most use to them ."
Research method	A case study of the subject eugenics in the Dewey Decimal Classification is presented to illustrate this phenomenon .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Eugenics is strange because of the kinds of changes it undergoes .
Research method	The article closes with a discussion of subject ontogeny as the name for this phenomenon and describes implications for information searching and browsing .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper , we provide a methodological resource for social scientists looking to expand their toolkit using unstructured web-based text , and in particular , with the Wayback Machine , to access historical website data ."
Research method	"After providing a literature review of existing research that uses the Wayback Machine , we put forward a step-by-step description of how the analyst can design a research project using archived websites ."
Research method	We draw on the example of a project that analyzes indicators of innovation activities and strategies in 300 U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises in green goods industries .
Research method	"We present six steps to access historical Wayback website data : ( a ) sampling , ( b ) organizing and defining the boundaries of the web crawl , ( c ) crawling , ( d ) website variable operationalization , ( e ) integration with other data sources , and ( f ) analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although our examples draw on specific types of firms in green goods industries , the method can be generalized to other areas of research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In discussing the limitations and benefits of using the Wayback Machine , we note that both machine and human effort are essential to developing a high-quality data set from archived web information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article presents a novel , empirically-based model of fiction reading in a public library context , taking into account the characteristics differentiating the readers of individual fiction genres ."
Research method	"It begins with a literature review of factors motivating a reading choice or habit , and of the effects of reading different fiction genres , before introducing three previous studies by the first author into readers ' attitudes towards , and engagement with , fiction and selected fiction genres ."
Research method	The methodologies are then summarized both for the three previous studies and the present study .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The authors present a combined analysis that integrates the Research findings/conclusions of the previous studies in order to generate a new , evidence-based model for the reading of fiction genres ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Incorporating both demographic and motivational aspects , this model illustrates how the broad themes of the fiction reader profile interrelate , giving them a new causal ordering ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , there is a discussion of the implications of this work for library and information science research and practitioner communities ."
Research method	Rasch analysis was used to examine the psychometric properties of the survey .
Research method	Structural equation modeling was subsequently used to examine the validity of hypothesized relationships among the constructs measured by the survey .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , Research findings/conclusions supported validity of the existing measure for use among researchers across academic disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	Recommendations for further refinement of the survey include the addition of new items to improve reliability of measurement .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , implications for organizational practice are discussed , including the importance of fostering individual researchers ' perceived usefulness of secondary data , as well as providing access to data repositories and organizational resources for data reuse ."
Research method	"Their databases use Web of Science ( WoS ) citation data , which they match according to their own matching algorithmsin the case of CWTS for standard usage in their studies and in the case of iFQ on an experimental basis ."
Research questions	"Because the problem of nonmatched citations in the WoS persists due to inaccuracies in the references or inaccuracies introduced in the data extraction process , it is important to ascertain how well these inaccuracies are rectified in these citation matching algorithms ."
Research method	This article evaluates the algorithms of CWTS and iFQ in comparison to the WoS in a quantitative and a qualitative analysis .
Research method	The analysis builds upon the method and the manually verified corpus of a previous study .
Research findings/conclusions	"The algorithm of CWTS performs best , closely followed by that of iFQ ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The WoS algorithm still performs quite well ( F-1 score : 96.41 % ) , but shows deficits in matching references containing inaccuracies ."
Research findings/conclusions	An additional problem is posed by incorrectly provided cited reference information in source articles by the WoS .
Research questions	"These scientific communities are , however , a challenging unit of analysis to capture and compare because they overlap , have fuzzy boundaries , and evolve over time ."
Research method	We describe a network analytic approach that reveals the complexities of these communities through the examination of their publication networks in combination with insights from ethnographic field studies .
Research findings/conclusions	"We suggest that the structures revealed indicate overlapping subcommunities within a research specialty , and we provide evidence that they differ in disciplinary orientation and research practices ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	By mapping the community structures of scientific fields we increase confidence about the domain of validity of ethnographic observations as well as of collaborative patterns extracted from publication networks thereby enabling the systematic study of field differences .
Research method	The network analytic methods presented include methods to optimize the delineation of a bibliographic data set to adequately represent a research specialty and methods to extract community structures from this data .
Research method	We demonstrate the application of these methods in a case study of two research specialties in the physical and chemical sciences .
Research findings/conclusions	"Searching GB for citations produces approximate matches , however , and so its raw results need time-consuming human filtering ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In response , this article introduces a method to automatically remove false and irrelevant matches from GB citation searches in addition to introducing refinements to a previous GB manual citation extraction method ."
Research method	"The method was evaluated by manual checking of sampled GB results and comparing citations to about 14,500 monographs in the Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index ( BKCI ) against automatically extracted citations from GB across 24 subject areas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"GB citations were 103 % to 137 % as numerous as BKCI citations in the humanities , except for tourism ( 72 % ) and linguistics ( 91 % ) , 46 % to 85 % in social sciences , but only 8 % to 53 % in the sciences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In all cases , however , GB had substantially more citing books than did BKCI , with BKCI 's results coming predominantly from journal articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moderate correlations between the GB and BKCI citation counts in social sciences and humanities , with most BKCI results coming from journal articles rather than books , suggests that they could measure the different aspects of impact , however ."
Research questions	"Despite such a crucial role of forenames , their effect on the performance of heuristic ( string matching ) and algorithmic disambiguation is not well understood ."
Research method	"This study assesses the contributions of forenames in author name disambiguation using multiple labeled data sets under varying ratios and lengths of full forenames , reflecting real-world scenarios in which an author is represented by forename variants ( synonym ) and some authors share the same forenames ( homonym ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that increasing the ratios of full forenames substantially improves both heuristic and machine-learning-based disambiguation .
Research findings/conclusions	Performance gains by algorithmic disambiguation are pronounced when many forenames are initialized or homonyms are prevalent .
Research findings/conclusions	"As the ratios of full forenames increase , however , they become marginal compared to those by string matching ."
Research findings/conclusions	Using a small portion of forename strings does not reduce much the performances of both heuristic and algorithmic disambiguation methods compared to using full-length strings .
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions provide practical suggestions , such as restoring initialized forenames into a full-string format via record linkage for improved disambiguation performances ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"At a time when scientific data were becoming exceedingly hard to manage , Brownson was instrumental in coordinating national and international efforts for more efficient , cost-effective , and universal information exchange ."
Research findings/conclusions	Her most significant contributions to documentation/information science were during her years at the National Science Foundation 's Office of Scientific Information .
Research findings/conclusions	"From 1951 to 1966 , Brownson played a key role in identifying and subsequently distributing government funds toward projects that sought to resolve information-handling problems of the time : information access , preservation , storage , classification , and retrieval ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"She is credited for communicating the need for information systems and indexing mechanisms to have stricter criteria , standards , and evaluation methods ; laying the foundation for present-day NSF-funded computational linguistics projects ; and founding several pertinent documentation/information science publications including the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study focuses on a special SNS discontinuance phenomenonuser exodus .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Compared to individual discontinuance behavior studied in prior research , the SNS user exodus possesses its own characteristics : a huge magnitude of users abandon a given SNS product in a very short time ."
Research questions	"Given the fatal blow of exodus to SNS providers , this exploratory research seeks to unravel why and how the SNS user exodus occurs ."
Research method	"Specifically , we conducted a mixed-method research combining laddering interview and network analysis ."
Research method	"Drawing on the means-end chain theory , laddering interviews were first used to collect data from discontinuers of a Chinese SNS , Kaixin001 , which has experienced a severe user dropout ."
Research method	Then we identified various factors triggering user exodus by content analysis .
Research method	"Last , network analysis was employed to establish the connections between various attributes , consequences , and values ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that user exodus in SNS is strongly related to three types of value : functional , affective , and social value ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"More important , we also emphasized the dynamics process of exodus by highlighting the role of lurking ."
Research findings/conclusions	Possible contributions and implications of our Research findings/conclusions are discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three periods are distinguished : ( A ) construction of the interdisciplinary space in the 1980s , ( B ) development of an interdisciplinary orientation in the 1990s , and ( C ) reintegration into cognitive psychology in the 2000s ."
Research findings/conclusions	The fluidity and fuzziness of the interdisciplinary delineations in the different visualizations can be reduced and clarified using factor analysis .
Research method	We also explore newly available routines ( CorText ) to analyze this development in terms of tubes using an alluvial map and compare the results with an animation ( using Visone ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The historical specificity of this development can be compared with the development of artificial intelligence into an integrated specialty during this same period .
Research findings/conclusions	Interdisciplinarity should be defined differently at the level of journals and of specialties .
Research findings/conclusions	"Neither the cosine nor the Pearson correlation should be used for the normalization of co-occurrence matrices because the similarity is then normalized twice , and therefore overestimated ; the Ochiai coefficient can be used instead ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results are shown using a small matrix ( 5 cases , 4 variables ) for didactic reasons , and also Ahlgren etal ."
Research method	's ( 2003 ) co-occurrence matrix of 24 authors in library and information sciences .
Research findings/conclusions	The overestimation is shown numerically and will be illustrated using multidimensional scaling and cluster dendograms .
Research findings/conclusions	If the occurrence matrix is not available ( such as in internet research or author cocitation analysis ) using Ochiai for the normalization is preferable to using the cosine .
Research questions	"In order to increase the marketing efficiency and ad effectiveness , there is a strong demand for viewability prediction from both advertisers and publishers ."
Research questions	"This paper aims to predict the dwell time for a given user , page , depth triplet based on historic data collected by publishers ."
Research questions	This problem is difficult because of user behavior variability and data sparsity .
Research findings/conclusions	"To solve it , we propose predictive models based on Factorization Machines and Field-aware Factorization Machines in order to overcome the data sparsity issue and provide flexibility to add auxiliary information such as the visible area of a user 's browser ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , we leverage the prior dwell time behavior of the user within the current page view , that is , time series information , to further improve the proposed models ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results using data from a large web publisher demonstrate that the proposed models outperform comparison models .
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , the results show that adding time series information further improves the performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In such a patent technology map , almost all pairs of technology classes are connected , whereas most of the connections between them are extremely weak ."
Research findings/conclusions	This observation suggests the possibility of filtering the patent network map by removing weak links .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , removing links may reduce the explanatory power of the network on inventor or organization diversification ."
Research findings/conclusions	The network links may explain the patent portfolio diversification paths of inventors and inventing organizations .
Research method	"We measure the diversification explanatory power of the patent network map , and present a method to objectively choose an optimal tradeoff between explanatory power and removing weak links ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We show that this method can remove a degree of arbitrariness compared with previous filtering methods based on arbitrary thresholds , and also identify previous filtering methods that created filters outside the optimal tradeoff ."
Research questions	"The filtered map aims to aid in network visualization analyses of the technological diversification of inventors , organizations , and other innovation agents , and potential foresight analysis ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Such applications to a prolific inventor ( Leonard Forbes ) and company ( Google ) are demonstrated .
Research questions	"However , due to the elusive nature of the concept of context , few studies have made it a focus of examination ."
Research method	"To fill this gap , we studied the context of consumer health information searching by analyzing questions posted on a social question and answer site : Yahoo !"
Research method	Answers .
Research method	"Based on the analysis , a model of context was developed ."
Research method	"The model consists of 5 layers : demographic , cognitive , affective , situational , and social and environmental ."
Research method	"The demographic layer contains demographic factors of the person of concern ; the cognitive layer contains factors related to the current search task ( specifically , topics of interest and information goals ) and users ' cognitive ability to articulate their needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	The affective layer contains different affective motivations and intentions behind the search .
Research findings/conclusions	The situational layer contains users ' perceptions of the current health condition and where the person is in the illness trajectory .
Research findings/conclusions	"The social and environmental layer contains users ' social roles , social norms , and various information channels ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Several novel system functions , including faceted search and layered presentation of results , are proposed based on the model to help contextualize and improve users ' interactions with health information systems ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	IntegraL provides a lightweight approach to improve and augment search functionality by dynamically generating context-focused anchors for recognized elements of interest generated by library services .
Research method	This article includes a description of how IntegraL 's design supports users ' information-seeking behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"A full user study with both objective and subjective measures of IntegraL and hypothesis testing regarding IntegraL 's effectiveness of the user 's information-seeking experience are described along with data analysis , implications arising from this kind of virtual integration , and possible future directions ."
Research method	"Parent-child relationships , related connections among the categories , and related connections among the subcategories in the subject directory were optimized using social network analysis ."
Research method	The optimization results were assessed by both density analysis and edge strength analysis methods .
Research method	"In addition , the results were evaluated by domain experts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From this study , it is recommended that four subcategories be switched from their original four categories into two different categories as a result of the parent-child relationship optimization.It is also recommended that 132 subcategories be moved to 40 subcategories and that eight categories be moved to two categories as a result of the related connection optimization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions show that optimization boosted the densities of the optimized categories , and the recommended connections of both the related categories and subcategories were stronger than the existing connections of the related categories and subcategories ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides visual displays of the optimization analysis as well as suggestions to enhance the subject directory of this portal .
Research findings/conclusions	Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern .
Research findings/conclusions	"The psychological stages broadly include befriending , information exchange , grooming , and approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages .
Research value/outlook/limitations	In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages .
Research method	A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage .
Research method	The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure .
Research method	To find the inter-post similarity a modified sentence similarity measure is used .
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed measure gives improved recognition of inter-stage and intra-stage similarity among the chat posts compared with other types of similarity measures .
Research method	The pairwise inter-post similarity is used for clustering chat-posts into the psychological stages .
Research findings/conclusions	Results of experiments demonstrate that the new clustering method gives better results than some current clustering methods .
Research questions	"When functioning well , HIT are a boon to mankind ."
Research questions	"However , HIT in the OR also create hazards for patients for a number of interrelated reasons ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We introduce 5 interrelated components of hazard situations for medical teams operating in the OR : complexity , overload/underload , inadequate individual training , inadequate training of medical teams , and overconfidence of surgeons ."
Research findings/conclusions	These components of hazard situations in the OR may negatively impact patient safety .
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss implications , especially in terms of individuals and medical teams in the OR , as well as work substitution as a broader aspect of the potential dark side of health IT ."
Research method	This article uses evidence from the book-based social website Goodreads to provide a large scale analysis of 50 major English book genres based on author genders .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show gender differences in authorship in almost all categories and gender differences the level of interest in , and ratings of , books in a minority of categories ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Perhaps surprisingly in this context , there is not a clear gender-based relationship between the success of an author and their prevalence within a genre ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The unexpected almost universal authorship gender differences should give new impetus to investigations of the importance of gender in fiction and the success of minority genders in some genres should encourage publishers and librarians to take their work seriously , except perhaps for most male-authored chick-lit ."
Research questions	"Given that microblogging users communicate with each other to form a social network , we hypothesize that user opinion is influenced by its neighbors in the network ."
Research method	"In this paper , we infer user opinion on a topic by combining two factors : the user 's historical opinion about relevant topics and opinion influence from his/her neighbors ."
Research questions	We thus build a topic-level opinion influence model ( TOIM ) by integrating both topic factor and opinion influence factor into a unified probabilistic model .
Research findings/conclusions	"We evaluate our model in one of the largest microblogging sites in China , Tencent Weibo , and the experiments show that TOIM outperforms baseline methods in opinion inference accuracy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , incorporating indirect influence further improves inference recall and f1-measure ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we demonstrate some useful applications of TOIM in analyzing users ' behaviors in Tencent Weibo ."
Research method	"In particular , we consider those users who have both topic and geographical preferences on promotion products as targeted users ."
Research questions	"To efficiently solve this problem , one challenge is how to find the targeted users and compute their preferences efficiently for given requests ."
Research method	"To address this challenge , we devise a TR-tree index structure , where each tree node stores users ' topic and geographical preferences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By traversing the TR-tree in depth-first order , we can efficiently find the targeted users ."
Research questions	Another challenge of the problem is to devise algorithms for efficient seeds selection .
Research method	We solve this challenge from two complementary directions .
Research method	"In one direction , we adopt the maximum influence arborescence ( MIA ) model to approximate the influence spread , and propose two efficient approximation algorithms with 1-1/e approximation ratio , which prune some candidate seeds with small influences by precomputing users ' initial influences offline and estimating the upper bound of their marginal influences online ."
Research method	"In the other direction , we propose a fast heuristic algorithm to improve efficiency ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms .
Research questions	"In particular , digital humanities ( DH ) , the subfield that has emerged as the site of most of this work , has received growing attention in higher education in recent years ."
Research questions	This study seeks to facilitate a better understanding of digital humanities by studying the motivations and practices of digital humanists as information workers in the humanities .
Research method	"To this end , we observe information work through interviews with DH scholars about their work practices and through a survey of DH programs such as graduate degrees , certificates , minors , and training institutes ."
Research questions	In this study we focus on how the goals behind methodology ( a link between theories and method ) surface in everyday DH work practices and in DH curricula in order to investigate if the critiques that have appeared in relation to DH information work are well founded and to suggest alternative narratives about information work in DH that will help advance the impact of the field in the humanities and beyond .
Research method	Online review data generated by authors who have experienced the submission process in 10 Chinese academic journals were collected .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of Spearman correlation analysis show that Chinese authors ' perceived responsiveness of an editorial office is positively correlated with perceived quality of the journal , and the total review time does not affect perceptions of the quality of a journal and its editorial responsiveness ."
Research questions	"Although reusing data might not yet be the norm in every discipline , the benefits of reusing shared data have been asserted by a number of researchers , and data reuse has been a major concern in many disciplines ."
Research questions	Assessing data for trustworthiness becomes important in data reuse with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and potential harm from using poor-quality data .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research explores many facets of data reusers ' trust in data generated by other researchers focusing on the trust judgment process with influential factors that determine reusers ' trust .
Research method	The author took an interpretive qualitative approach by using in-depth semistructured interviews as the primary research method .
Research findings/conclusions	The study results suggest different stages of trust development associated with the process of data reuse .
Research findings/conclusions	"Data reusers ' trust may remain the same throughout their experiences , but it can also be formed , lost , declined , and recovered during their data reuse experiences ."
Research findings/conclusions	These various stages reflect the dynamic nature of trust .
Research questions	"Because of a common focus on communication , these perspectives can be combined as a set of methodologies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Latour 's sociology of translations specifies a mechanism for generating variation in relations ( associations ) , whereas Luhmann 's systems perspective enables the specification of ( functionally different ) selection environments such as markets , professional organizations , and political control ."
Research findings/conclusions	Selection environments can be considered as mechanisms of social coordination that can self-organizebeyond the control of human agencyinto regimes in terms of interacting codes of communication .
Research findings/conclusions	"Unlike relatively globalized regimes , technological trajectories are organized locally in landscapes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A resulting duality of structure ( Giddens , 1979 ) between the historical organization of trajectories and evolutionary self-organization at the regime level can be expected to drive innovation cycles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Reflexive translations add a third layer of perspectives to ( a ) the relational analysis of observable links that shape trajectories and ( b ) the positional analysis of networks in terms of latent dimensions .
Research findings/conclusions	"These three operations can be studied in a single framework , but using different methodologies ."
Research findings/conclusions	Latour 's first-order associations can then be analytically distinguished from second-order translations in terms of requiring other communicative competencies .
Research findings/conclusions	"The resulting operations remain infrareflexively nested , and can therefore be used for innovative reconstructions of previously constructed boundaries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	These corpora are untapped resources to understand social expressions on diverse subjects .
Research questions	Microblog analysis aims to unlock the value of such expressions by discovering insights and events of significance hidden among swathes of text .
Research findings/conclusions	"Besides velocity ; diversity of content , brevity , absence of structure and time-sensitivity are key challenges in microblog analysis ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we propose an unsupervised incremental machine learning and event detection technique to address these challenges ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The proposed technique separates a microblog discussion into topics to address the key problem of diversity .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It maintains a record of the evolution of each topic over time .
Research findings/conclusions	"Brevity , time-sensitivity and unstructured nature are addressed by these individual topic pathways which contribute to generate a temporal , topic-driven structure of a microblog discussion ."
Research method	The proposed event detection method continuously monitors these topic pathways using multiple domain-independent event indicators for events of significance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The autonomous nature of topic separation , topic pathway generation , new topic identification and event detection , appropriates the proposed technique for extensive applications in microblog analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	We demonstrate these capabilities on tweets containing # microsoft and tweets containing # obama .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Despite vocal concerns , a closer look at the empirical and methodological limitations of research on bias raises questions about the existence and extent of many hypothesized forms of bias ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the notion of bias is predicated on an implicit ideal that , once articulated , raises questions about the normative implications of research on bias in peer review ."
Research method	"This review provides a brief description of the function , history , and scope of peer review ; articulates and critiques the conception of bias unifying research on bias in peer review ; characterizes and examines the empirical , methodological , and normative claims of bias in peer review research ; and assesses possible alternatives to the status quo ."
Research questions	We close by identifying ways to expand conceptions and studies of bias to contend with the complexity of social interactions among actors involved directly and indirectly in peer review .
Research questions	"However , it is unclear whether current ASNSs have fulfilled their design goal , as scholars ' actual online interactions on these platforms remain unexplored ."
Research method	"To fill the gap , this article presents a study based on data collected from ResearchGate ."
Research method	"Adopting a mixed-method design by conducting qualitative content analysis and statistical analysis on 1,128 posts collected from ResearchGate Q & A , we examine how scholars exchange information and resources , and how their practices vary across three distinct disciplines : library and information services , history of art , and astrophysics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that the effect of a questioner 's intention ( i.e. , seeking information or discussion ) is greater than disciplinary factors in some circumstances ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Across the three disciplines , responses to questions provide various resources , including experts ' contact details , citations , links to Wikipedia , images , and so on ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We further discuss several implications of the understanding of scholarly information exchange and the design of better academic social networking interfaces , which should stimulate scholarly interactions by minimizing confusion , improving the clarity of questions , and promoting scholarly content management ."
Research questions	"With its exponential growth and the public nature and transversality of its contents , more researchers are using Twitter as a source of data for multiple Research questionss ."
Research questions	"In this context , the ability to retrieve those messages ( tweets ) related to a certain topic becomes critical ."
Research questions	"In this work , we define the topic-related tweet retrieval task and propose a dynamic , graph-based method with which to address it ."
Research method	"We have applied our method to capture a data set containing tweets related to the participation of the Spanish team in the Euro 2012 soccer competition , measuring the precision and recall against other simple but commonly used approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , which significantly increases coverage of the chosen topic and is able to capture related but unknown a priori subtopics ."
Research questions	"To date , the issue of customer participation in online social shopping communities has become an important but underexplored research area in the academic literature ."
Research questions	"In this study , we examined how online social interactions affect customer information contribution behavior ."
Research questions	We also explored the moderating role of customer reputation in the relationship between observational learning and reinforcement learning as well as customer information contribution behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"Analyses of panel data from 6,121 customers in an online social fashion platform revealed that they are significant factors affecting customer information contribution behavior and that reinforcement learning exhibits a stronger effect than observational learning ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results also showed that customer reputation has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between observational learning and customer information contribution behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	This study not only enriched our theoretical understanding of information contribution behavior but also provided guidelines for online social shopping community administrators to better design their community features .
Research method	"In order to test this hypothesis , a longitudinal analysis of the internal units of the Spanish university system was conducted over the course of 2010 ."
Research method	"For the 13,800 URLs identified , page count and visibility were calculated using the Yahoo !"
Research findings/conclusions	API .
Research method	The internal values obtained were aggregated by university and compared with the values obtained from the analysis of the universities ' general URLs .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that , although the correlations between general and internal values are high , internal performance is low in comparison to general performance , and that they give rise to different performance rankings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The conclusion is that the aggregation of unit performance is of limited use due to the low levels of internal development of the websites , and so its use is not recommended for the design of rankings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite this , the internal analysis enabled the detection of , among other things , a low correlation between page count and visibility due to the widespread use of subdirectories and problems accessing certain content ."
Research method	The consensus opinion from aggregation of star ratings is used as a proxy for item quality .
Research findings/conclusions	Online reviews are noisy and effective aggregation of star ratings to accurately reflect the true quality of products and services is challenging .
Research findings/conclusions	The mean-rating aggregation model is widely used and other aggregation models are also proposed .
Research findings/conclusions	These existing aggregation models rely on a large number of reviews to tolerate noise .
Research questions	"However , many products rarely have reviews ."
Research method	We propose probabilistic aggregation models for review ratings based on the Dirichlet distribution to combat data sparsity in reviews .
Research method	We further propose to exploit the helpfulness social information and time to filter noisy reviews and effectively aggregate ratings to compute the consensus opinion .
Research findings/conclusions	Our experiments on an Amazon data set show that our probabilistic aggregation models based on helpfulness achieve better performance than the statistical and heuristic baseline approaches .
Research questions	"Preserving the integrity of science , and by extension society , in the era of Twitter and Facebook represents a significant challenge ."
Research questions	The concept of open communication in science is not a new one .
Research questions	"Sociologist and scientific historian Robert Merton elegantly chronicled the qualities , or norms of science as Communism , Universalism , Disinterestedness , and Organized Scepticism , referred to by the acronym CUDOS ."
Research questions	"Is social networking providing us with more efficient ways of upholding deep-rooted principles , or are we at risk of compromising the integrity of science by bypassing traditional gatekeepers ?"
Research method	"It combines literature on the definition , history , usefulness , and limitations of RIL and includes a brief analysis of the 4 published digital library image reuse assessment case studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In its conclusion , the communication paper proposes that RIL offers benefits for digital library managers in the assessment of their collections ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The participants acknowledged that D-IKC brought about many benefits , including the surfacing of otherwise hidden or inaccessible cultural heritage ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Concerns around digital access , digital competency , and responsiveness to cultural values need to be thoughtfully addressed nevertheless ."
Research findings/conclusions	Use of D-IKC had impact not only at an individual level but also at a social-community level .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We highlight several traditional cultural values related to D-IKC use that are not embodied in existing value-impact frameworks .
Research findings/conclusions	"This research also found that the intersection and interactions among individual needs , cultural expectations , and norms and affordances around the digital information environments concerned were nuanced and multifaceted ."
Research findings/conclusions	These facets must be incorporated into the stewardship of knowledge collections .
Research findings/conclusions	We also observed digital knowledge sharing in the wild-knowledge transmission that transpired and in some cases led to creation of knowledge resources that materialized outside the bounds of the originating repositories and institutions .
Research findings/conclusions	Further studies into such self-organized knowledge transmission/sharing phenomena can lead to valuable insights to inform and shape the curation and design of D-IKC .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"With this exploratory tool , we can understand better the journal 's dual roles of citing and being cited in a reference network ."
Research method	The h-plot is introduced and its use is validated with a set of 25 journals belonging to the statistics area .
Research method	"The relatedness factor is considered for describing the relations of citations from a journal i to a journal j , and the citations from the journal j to the journal i ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More information has been extracted from the h-plot , compared with other statistical techniques for modelling and representing asymmetric data , such as multidimensional unfolding ."
Research questions	"They play essential roles in knowledge infrastructures-robust networks of people , artifacts , and institutions-but little is known about how they mediate information exchange between stakeholders ."
Research method	"We open the black box of data archives by studying DANS , the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands , which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences , humanities , and other domains ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our interviews , weblogs , ethnography , and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content , but most are academic researchers who submit data sets infrequently and often restrict access to their files ."
Research findings/conclusions	Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors .
Research questions	Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Given the diversity and infrequency of usage , human assistance in curation and search remains essential ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"DANS ' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute , consume , harvest , and serve their data-many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated-reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities , technologies , and services evolve ."
Research method	"Because proverbs can be described and indexed by multiple characteristics and criteria , we built a multidimensional ontology suitable for proverb classification ."
Research method	"To evaluate the effectiveness of the constructed ontology for improving search and retrieval of proverbs , a large-scale user experiment was arranged with 70 users who were asked to search a proverb repository using ontology-based and free-text search interfaces ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The comparative analysis of the results shows that the use of this ontology helped to substantially improve the search recall , precision , user satisfaction , and efficiency and to minimize user effort during the search process ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	A practical contribution of this work is an automated web-based proverb search and retrieval system which incorporates the proposed ontological scheme and an initial corpus of ontology-based annotated proverbs .
Research findings/conclusions	It is essential to index the images at the right level of description and ensure that the indexed levels match the user 's interest level .
Research method	"This study examines 240 medical-image descriptions produced by three different groups of medical-image users ( novices , intermediates , and experts ) in the area of radiography ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This article reports several important Research findings/conclusions : First , the effect of domain knowledge has a significant relationship with the use of semantic image attributes in image-users ' descriptions ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that experts employ more high-level image attributes which require high-reasoning or diagnostic knowledge to search for a medical image ( Abstract Objects and Scenes ) than do novices ; novices are more likely to describe some basic objects which do not require much radiological knowledge to search for an image they need ( Generic Objects ) than are experts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , all image users in this study prefer to use image attributes of the semantic levels to represent the image that they desired to find , especially using those specific-level and scene-related attributes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Third , image attributes generated by medical-image users can be mapped to all levels of the pyramid model that was developed to structure visual information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , the pyramid model could be considered a robust instrument for indexing medical imagery ."
Research method	"As an example , we apply our methodological approach to the study of the keywords in the Library and Information Sciences ( LIS ) area ."
Research questions	Our objective is to detect the new author keywords that appear in a fixed knowledge area in the period of 1 year in order to quantify the probabilities of survival for 10 years as a function of the impact of the journals where they appeared .
Research findings/conclusions	Many of the new keywords appearing in the LIS field are ephemeral .
Research findings/conclusions	"Actually , more than half are never used again ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In general , the terms most commonly used in the LIS area come from other areas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The average survival time of these keywords is approximately 3 years , being slightly higher in the case of words that were published in journals classified in the second quartile of the area ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We believe that measuring the appearance and disappearance of terms will allow understanding some relevant aspects of the evolution of a discipline , providing in this way a new bibliometric approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	A portfolio analysis may aim to identify the gap between the current position of an organization and a goal that it intends to achieve or identify competencies of multiple institutions .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We introduce a new visual analytic method for analyzing , comparing , and contrasting characteristics of publication portfolios ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The new method introduces a novel design of dual-map thematic overlays on global maps of science .
Research findings/conclusions	"Each publication portfolio can be added as one layer of dual-map overlays over 2 related , but distinct , global maps of science : one for citing journals and the other for cited journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	We demonstrate how the new design facilitates a portfolio analysis in terms of patterns emerging from the distributions of citation threads and the dynamics of trajectories as a function of space and time .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We first demonstrate the analysis of portfolios defined on a single source article .
Research method	"Then we contrast publication portfolios of multiple comparable units of interest ; namely , colleges in universities and corporate research organizations ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also include examples of overlays of scientific fields .
Research findings/conclusions	We expect that our method will provide new insights to portfolio analysis .
Research questions	"In work , work task ( WT ) performance forms the context , which information searching should serve ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , information retrieval ( IR ) systems development/evaluation should take the WT context into account ."
Research method	"The present paper analyzes how WT features : task complexity and task types , affect information searching in authentic work : the types of information needs , search processes , and search media ."
Research method	"We collected data on 22 information professionals in authentic work situations in three organization types : city administration , universities , and companies ."
Research method	The data comprise 286 WTs and 420 search tasks ( STs ) .
Research method	"The data include transaction logs , video recordings , daily questionnaires , interviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	and observation .
Research method	The data were analyzed quantitatively .
Research findings/conclusions	"Even if the participants used a range of search media , most STs were simple throughout the data , and up to 42 % of WTs did not include searching ."
Research findings/conclusions	WT 's effects on STs are not straightforward : different WT types react differently to WT complexity .
Research findings/conclusions	"Due to the simplicity of authentic searching , the WT/ST types in interactive IR experiments should be reconsidered ."
Research questions	Traditional citation-based analyses treat all citations equally even though there can be various reasons and different levels of relevancy for one document to reference another .
Research findings/conclusions	Taking the relevancy level into consideration is intuitively advantageous because it adopts more accurate information and will thus make the results of a citation-based analysis more trustworthy .
Research questions	This is nevertheless a challenging task .
Research findings/conclusions	We are aware of no citation-based analysis that has taken the relevancy level into consideration .
Research questions	The difficulty lies in the fact that the existing patent or patent citation database provides no readily available relevancy level information .
Research method	We overcome this issue by obtaining citation relevancy information from a legal database that has relevancy level ranked by legal experts .
Research method	"This paper selects trademark dilution , a legal concept that has been the subject of many lawsuit cases , as the target for exploration ."
Research method	"We apply main path analysis , taking citation relevancy into consideration , and verify the results against a set of test cases that are mentioned in an authoritative trademark book ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions show that relevancy information helps main path analysis uncover legal cases of higher importance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , in terms of the number of significant cases retrieved , relevancy information does not seem to make a noticeable difference ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using this measure , the interaction among three dimensions can become negative and thus indicate a net export of uncertainty by a system or , in other words , synergy in how knowledge functions are distributed over the carriers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Aggregation at the regional level ( NUTS3 ) of the data organized at the municipal level ( NUTS5 ) shows that 48.5 % of the regional synergy is provided by the 3 metropolitan regions of Stockholm , Gothenburg , and Malmo/Lund ."
Research findings/conclusions	Sweden can be considered a centralized and hierarchically organized system .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results accord with other statistics , but this triple helix indicator measures synergy more specifically and quantitatively ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The analysis also provides us with validation for using this measure in previous studies of more regionalized systems of innovation ( such as Hungary and Norway ) .
Research method	These approaches describe images by using semantic attributes as the mid-level feature .
Research questions	"However , low recognition accuracy becomes the biggest barrier that limits their practical applications ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we propose a novel framework termed Boosting Attribute Recognition ( BAR ) for the image recognition task ."
Research method	"Our framework stems from matrix factorization , and can explore latent relationships from the aspect of attribute and image simultaneously ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , to apply our framework in large-scale visual recognition tasks , we present both offline and online learning implementation of the proposed framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive experiments on 3 data sets demonstrate that our framework achieves a sound accuracy of attribute recognition .
Research method	"This article reports on Research findings/conclusions from research following three small teams of information professionals as they implemented emulation practices into their digital preservation programs at a technology museum , a university research library , and a university research archive and technology lab ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results suggest that the distributed teams in this cohort of preservationists have developed different emulation practices for particular kinds of emulation encounters in supporting different types of access .
Research findings/conclusions	"I discuss the implications of these Research findings/conclusions for digital preservation research and emulation initiatives providing access to software or software-dependent objects , showing how implications of these Research findings/conclusions have significance for those developing software preservation workflows and building emulation capacities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions suggest that different emulation practices for preservation , research access , and exhibition undertaken in libraries , archives , and museums result in different forms of access to preserved software-accessing information and experiential access ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In examining particular types of access , this research calls into question software emulation as a single , static preservation strategy for information institutions and challenges researchers to examine new forms of access and descriptive representation emerging from these digital preservation strategies ."
Research findings/conclusions	Forcing the system to predict a fixed-length list for each user may result in different confidence levels for the computed recommendations .
Research findings/conclusions	Reporting the system 's confidence in its predictions ( the recommendation strength ) can provide valuable information to users in making their decisions .
Research questions	"In this article , we investigate several different displays of a system 's confidence to users and conclude that some displays are easier to understand and are favored by most users ."
Research questions	We continue to investigate the effect confidence has on users in terms of their perception of the recommendation quality and the user experience with the system .
Research findings/conclusions	Our studies show that it is not easier for users to identify relevant items when confidence is displayed .
Research findings/conclusions	"Still , users appreciate the displays and trust them when the relevance of items is difficult to establish ."
Research method	"For this task , the nearest-neighbor-based scheme works in two phases : first , it finds the most similar neighbors of a new image from the set of labeled images ; then , it propagates the keywords associated with the neighbors to the new image ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we propose a novel approach for image annotation , which simultaneously improves both phases of the nearest-neighbor-based scheme ."
Research questions	"In the phase of neighbor search , different from existing work discovering the nearest neighbors with the predicted distance , we introduce a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism ( RNSM ) , where the ordering of labeled images is optimized directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction ."
Research questions	"In the phase of keyword propagation , different from existing work using simple heuristic rules to select the propagated keywords , we present a learning-based keyword propagation strategy ( LKPS ) , where a scoring function is learned to evaluate the relevance of keywords based on their multiple relations with the nearest neighbors ."
Research method	Extensive experiments on the Corel 5K data set and the MIR Flickr data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the process by which the specific field is divided into subfields is problematic , in the sense that citation information among individual patents in different subfields is lost ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If convergence technologies are common among different subfields , this problem can result in an inappropriate main path being found ."
Research method	"To resolve this problem , we propose a new algorithm capable of extracting the main paths for each subfield of a technology by using the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) codes of patents ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The proposed algorithm is applied to the waste management field to allow core technologies in the subfields of waste disposal , waste treatment , and the reuse of waste materials to be found ."
Research method	"Finally , a sensitivity analysis is performed by considering the standard of the component ratio along a specific path to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm in the waste management field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Given the importance of the applications , bibliometricians are obligated to carry out empirical testing of the robustness of the indicators , in simulations of real contexts ."
Research method	"In this work , we compare the results of national-scale research assessments at the individual level , based on the following three different indexes : the h-index , the g-index , and fractional scientific strength ( FSS ) , an indicator previously proposed by the authors ."
Research method	"For each index , we construct and compare rankings lists of all Italian academic researchers working in the hard sciences during the period 2001-2005 ."
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis quantifies the shifts in ranks that occur when researchers ' productivity rankings by simple indicators such as the h- or g-indexes are compared with those by more accurate FSS .
Research questions	"Unfortunately , less-than-satisfying effectiveness in state-of-the-art information-retrieval techniques is well known , even for some of the best search engines such as Google ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this study , the authors resolve this retrieval ineffectiveness problem by developing a new framework for predicting query performance , which is the first step toward better retrieval effectiveness ."
Research questions	"Specifically , they examine the relationship between query performance and query context ."
Research method	"A query context consists of the query itself , the document collection , and the interaction between the two ."
Research method	The authors first analyze the characteristics of query context and develop various features for predicting query performance .
Research method	"Then , they propose a context-sensitive model for predicting query performance based on the characteristics of the query and the document collection ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , they validate this model with respect to five real-world collections of documents and demonstrate its utility in routing queries to the correct repository with high accuracy ."
Research method	"In this study , we present a review of different author credit-assignment schemas , which are designed mainly based on author position and the total number of coauthors on the publication ."
Research method	"We implemented , tested , and classified 15 author credit-assignment schemas into 3 types : linear , curve , and other assignment schemas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further investigation and analysis revealed that most of the methods provide reasonable credit-assignment results , even though the credit-assignment distribution approaches are quite different among different types ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The evaluation of each schema based on PubMed articles published in 2013 shows that there exist positive correlations among different schemas and that the similarity of credit-assignment distributions can be derived from the similar design principles that stress the number of coauthors or the author position , or consider both ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide a summary about the features of each credit-assignment schema to facilitate the selection of the appropriate one , depending on the different conditions required to meet diverse needs ."
Research method	"This article revisits the causal relationship between research articles published and economic growth in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) countries for the period 1981-2011 , using bootstrap panel causality analysis , which accounts for cross-section dependency and heterogeneity across countries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The article , by the use of the specific method and the choice of the country group , makes a contribution to the existing literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our empirical results support unidirectional causality running from research output ( in terms of total number of articles published ) to economic growth for the US , Finland , Hungary , and Mexico ; the opposite causality from economic growth to research articles published for Canada , France , Italy , New Zealand , the UK , Austria , Israel , and Poland ; and no causality for the rest of the countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions provide important policy implications for research policies and strategies for OECD countries .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we document that the growing number of physics articles in recent years is attributed to existing journals publishing more and more articles rather than more new journals coming into being as it happens in computer science ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , even though the references from the more recent articles generally cover a longer time span , the newer articles are cited more frequently than the older ones if the uneven article growth is not corrected for ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , despite this change in the distribution of citations , the citation behavior of scientists does not seem to have changed ."
Research method	"Their analysis considers the ways in which each paradigm defines the concepts of community , information , and technology ."
Research questions	It also explores the insights offered by each paradigm regarding relationships between community and both information and technology .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Accordingly , the authors highlight the ways in which existing information behavior and informatics scholarship draws from similar conceptual roots ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Key insights drawn from this research , as well as remaining gaps and research questions , are examined ."
Research questions	"Additionally , they consider the limitations of each approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The authors conclude by arguing for the value of a vigorous research program regarding information behavior and technology use in communities , particularly that which takes the community as the central unit of analysis ."
Research questions	"They consider key questions that could drive such a research program , as well as potentially fruitful conceptual and methodological approaches for this endeavor ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study proposes that the social effect of an outstanding scholar , which is derived from the halo effect and the Matthew effect , is favorable for the expansion of the scholar 's personal research network and will improve that scholar 's future research accomplishments ."
Research method	Data for a total of 101 outstanding information systems scholars and 36 ordinary scholars were collected .
Research method	The definition of an outstanding scholar is based on the quality and quantity of their publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the social effect of the outstanding scholars is beneficial for the development of a research network , including 3 types of network structures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , being highly connected with colleagues leads to higher research accomplishments in terms of quantity , while being connected with colleagues from different sub-fields leads to higher research accomplishments in terms of novelty ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , this study found that the social effect of outstanding scholars is a double-edged sword , with both positive and negative impacts on research accomplishments ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions contribute several theoretical and practical implications for future research .
Research questions	The structure of these ontologies is typically not flat because there are hierarchical and nonhierarchical relationships among topics .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a consequence , websites classified under a certain topic may be relevant to other topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although some of these relevance relations are explicit , most of them must be discovered by an analysis of the structure of the ontologies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes a family of models of relevance propagation in topic ontologies .
Research method	An efficient computational framework is described and used to compute nine different models for a portion of the Open Directory Project graph consisting of more than half a million nodes and approximately 1.5 million edges of different types .
Research method	"After performing a quantitative analysis , a user study was carried out to compare the most promising models ."
Research findings/conclusions	It was found that some general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining flawless models of relevance propagation that only take into account structural aspects of an ontology .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , there is a clear indication that including transitive relations induced by the nonhierarchical components of the ontology results in relevance propagation models that are superior to more basic approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At the same time , the literature demonstrates a common understanding that paradigmatic relations are the kinds of semantic relations used in thesauri and other knowledge organization systems ( including equivalence relations , hierarchical relations , and associative relations ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This understanding is problematic and harmful because it directs attention away from the empirical and contextual basis for knowledge-organizing systems .
Research findings/conclusions	Whether A is a kind of X is certainly not context-free and definitional in empirical sciences or in much everyday information .
Research questions	"Semantic relations are theory-dependent and , in biology , for example , a scientific revolution has taken place in which many relations have changed following the new taxonomic paradigm named cladism ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This biological example is not an exception , but the norm ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Semantic relations including paradigmatic relations are not a priori but are dependent on subject knowledge , scientific Research findings/conclusions , and paradigms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As long as information scientists and knowledge organizers isolate themselves from subject knowledge , knowledge organization can not possibly progress ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Research has shown that search engine users seem to trust the search engines ' ranking uncritically and mostly select top-ranked results .
Research questions	This study further examines search engine users ' selection behavior .
Research questions	"Drawing from the credibility and information research literature , we test whether the presence or absence of certain credibility cues influences the selection probability of search engine results ."
Research method	"In an observational study , participants ( N=247 ) completed two information research tasks on preset search engine results pages , on which three credibility cues ( source reputation , message neutrality , and social recommendations ) as well as the search result ranking were systematically varied ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of our study confirm the significance of the ranking .
Research findings/conclusions	"Of the three credibility cues , only reputation had an additional effect on selection probabilities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Personal characteristics ( prior knowledge about the researched issues , search engine usage patterns , etc . )"
Research findings/conclusions	did not influence the preference for search results linked with certain credibility cues .
Research findings/conclusions	"These Research findings/conclusions are discussed in light of situational and contextual characteristics ( e.g. , involvement , low-cost scenarios ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Its promises of free , universal , and easy access to scientific literature coupled with the perception that it covers the social sciences and the humanities better than other traditional multidisciplinary databases have contributed to the quick expansion of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics : 2 new bibliometric products that offer citation data at the individual level and at journal level ."
Research method	"In this article , we show the results of an experiment undertaken to analyze Google Scholar 's capacity to detect citation-counting manipulation ."
Research method	"For this , we uploaded 6 documents to an institutional web domain that were authored by a fictitious researcher and referenced all the publications of the members of the EC3 research group at the University of Granada ."
Research findings/conclusions	The detection by Google Scholar of these papers caused an outburst in the number of citations included in the Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors .
Research questions	"We discuss the effects of such an outburst and how it could affect the future development of such products , at both the individual level and the journal level , especially if Google Scholar persists with its lack of transparency ."
Research questions	"In this paper , motivated by a psychological theory of word meaning , we propose a graph-based approach to constructing a cross-language association dictionary ( CLAD ) from Wikipedia , which can be used in a variety of cross-language accessing and processing applications ."
Research questions	"In order to evaluate the quality of the mined CLAD , and to demonstrate how the mined CLAD can be used in practice , we explore two different applications of the mined CLAD to cross-language information retrieval ( CLIR ) ."
Research method	"First , we use the mined CLAD to conduct cross-language query expansion ; and , second , we use it to filter out translation candidates with low translation probabilities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experimental results on a variety of standard CLIR test collections show that the CLIR retrieval performance can be substantially improved with the above two applications of CLAD , which indicates that the mined CLAD is of sound quality ."
Research questions	"The goal of this substudy was to examine the relationships between measures of self-reported health information behavior and neural measures of health information processing in a sample of 19 prehypertensive African Americans ( mean age = 52.5 , 52.6 % women ) ."
Research method	"We measured ( a ) health information seeking , sharing , and use ( surveys ) and ( b ) neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to assess response to health information videos ."
Research method	"We hypothesized that differential activation ( comparison of analytic vs. empathic brain activity when watching a specific type of video ) would indicate better function in three , distinct cognitive domains : ( a ) Analytic Network , ( b ) Default Mode Network ( DMN ) , and ( c ) ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Scores on the information sharing measure ( but not seeking or use ) were positively associated with differential activation in the vmPFC ( rs = .53 , p = .02 ) and the DMN ( rs = .43 , p = .06 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions correspond with previous work indicating that activation of the DMN and vmPFC is associated with sharing information to persuade others and with behavior change .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although health information is commonly conveyed as detached and analytic in nature , our Research findings/conclusions suggest that neural processing of socially and emotionally salient health information is more closely associated with health information sharing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although they are an objective resource for such evaluation , they also present drawbacks : ( a ) the uncertainty about the definite position of a target journal in the corresponding annual ranking when selecting a journal , and ( b ) in spite of the nonsignificant difference in score ( for instance , impact factor ) between consecutive journals in the ranking , the journals are strictly ranked and eventually placed in different terciles/quartiles , which may have a significant influence in the subsequent evaluation ."
Research questions	In this article we present several proposals to obtain an aggregated consensus ranking as an alternative/complementary tool to standardize annual rankings .
Research method	"To illustrate the proposed methodology we use as a case study the Journal Citation Reports , and in particular the category of Computer Science : Artificial Intelligence ( CS : AI ) ."
Research method	"In the context of the consensus rankings obtained by the different methods , we discuss the convenience of using one or the other procedure according to the corresponding framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , our proposals allow us to obtain consensus rankings that avoid crisp frontiers between similarly ranked journals and consider the longitudinal/temporal evolution of the journals ."
Research questions	"Because Wikipedia is a regular topic of JASIST publications ( Lim , 2009 ; Meseguer-Artola , Aibar , Llados , Minguillon , & Lerga , ; Mesgari , Okoli , Mehdi , Nielsen , & Lanamaki , ; Okoli , Mehdi , Mesgari , Nielsen , & Lanamaki , ) , we hope to start a useful discussion with the right audience ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , deep learning models are more demanding for training data ."
Research questions	"Data augmentation techniques are widely used to generate new instances based on modifications to existing data or relying on external knowledge bases to address annotated data scarcity , which hinders the full potential of machine learning techniques ."
Research questions	This paper presents our work using part-of-speech ( POS ) focused lexical substitution for data augmentation ( PLSDA ) to enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms in sentiment analysis .
Research method	We exploit POS information to identify words to be replaced and investigate different augmentation strategies to find semantically related substitutions when generating new instances .
Research findings/conclusions	The choice of POS tags as well as a variety of strategies such as semantic-based substitution methods and sampling methods are discussed in detail .
Research method	"Performance evaluation focuses on the comparison between PLSDA and two previous lexical substitution-based data augmentation methods , one of which is thesaurus-based , and the other is lexicon manipulation based ."
Research method	"Our approach is tested on five English sentiment analysis benchmarks : SST-2 , MR , IMDB , Twitter , and AirRecord ."
Research method	Hyperparameters such as the candidate similarity threshold and number of newly generated instances are optimized .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that six classifiers ( SVM , LSTM , BiLSTM-AT , bidirectional encoder representations from transformers [ BERT ] , XLNet , and RoBERTa ) trained with PLSDA achieve accuracy improvement of more than 0.6 % comparing to two previous lexical substitution methods averaged on five benchmarks ."
Research findings/conclusions	Introducing POS constraint and well-designed augmentation strategies can improve the reliability of lexical data augmentation methods .
Research findings/conclusions	"Consequently , PLSDA significantly improves the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms ."
Research questions	It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation .
Research method	"In this article , we mine a massive data set of web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias : ( i ) homogeneity bias , which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources , and ( ii ) popularity bias , which is the selective exposure to content from top sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used web platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	"Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources , while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites , we find higher levels of popularity bias , with smaller differences across applications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside social bubbles ."
Research questions	The objective was to ascertain countries ' capacity to establish intra- and extraregional scientific collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that increased output and citations in medical research have heightened the region 's presence and participation in the international scientific arena .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions may be partly influenced by the inclusion of new journals in the database and regional initiatives that may have enhanced collaboration and knowledge transfer in science .
Research findings/conclusions	The overall rise in partnering rates is slightly greater intra- than extraregionally .
Research findings/conclusions	"The possible effect of geographic , idiomatic , and cultural proximity is likewise identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	The scientific dependence of small or developing countries would explain their high collaboration rates and impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"The evidence shows that the most productive countries draw from knowledge generated domestically or by their neighbors , which would explain why impact is so highly concentrated in the regions with the greatest output ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The need to incentivize intraregional relationships must be stressed , although international initiatives should also be supported ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Extracting bacterial biotope entities from scientific publications is important to large scale study of the relationships between bacteria and their living environments .
Research method	"To facilitate the further development of robust habitat text mining systems for biodiversity , following the BioNLP task framework , three sequence labeling techniques , CRFs ( Conditional Random Fields ) , MEMM ( Maximum Entropy Markov Model ) and SVMhmm ( Support Vector Machine ) and one classifier , SVMmulticlass , are compared on their performance in identifying three types of bacterial biotope entities : bacteria , habitats and geographical locations ."
Research method	"The effectiveness of a variety of basic word formation features , syntactic features , and semantic features are exploited and compared for the three sequence labeling methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments on two publicly available BioNLP collections show that , in addition to a Word Net feature , word embedding featured clusters ( although not trained with the task-specific corpus ) consistently improve the performance for all methods on all entity types in both collections ."
Research findings/conclusions	Other features produce various results .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results also show that when trained on limited corpora .
Research findings/conclusions	Brown clusters resulted in better performance than word embedding clusters did .
Research findings/conclusions	Further analysis suggests that the entity recognition performance can be greatly boosted through improving the accuracy of entity boundary identification .
Research method	"The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , which is often the source of this funding , considers proposed projects based on the criteria of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts ."
Research questions	"However , these merit review criteria have been criticized as being insufficiently specific and not appropriate for all types of scientific research ."
Research method	"In an effort to examine the extent to which funded projects represented Broader Impacts , the researchers performed a content analysis of the abstracts from projects in the National Science Digital Library , an NSF project that crossed many disciplines and applications , but is of particular relevance to information scientists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When the results of these analyses are placed in the context of the controversy surrounding the Broader Impacts merit review criterion , it is clear that this criterion is interpreted broadly and that even successful proposals often include aspirational or incomplete claims of impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Because current proposed revisions to the merit review criteria that include emphases on demonstrable innovation and economic benefit will likely only complicate proposers ' abilities to describe their projects ' potentials , researchers may benefit from a greater understanding of Broader Impacts and how they can be clearly expressed to reviewers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Institutions rarely inform their students about LA practices , and there exist significant privacy concerns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Without a clear student voice in the design of LA , institutions put themselves in an ethical gray area ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To help fill this gap in practice and add to the growing literature on students ' privacy perspectives , this study reports Research findings/conclusions from over 100 interviews with undergraduate students at eight U.S. higher education institutions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions demonstrate that students lacked awareness of educational data-mining and analytic practices , as well as the data on which they rely ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Students see potential in LA , but they presented nuanced arguments about when and with whom data should be shared ; they also expressed why informed consent was valuable and necessary ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The study uncovered perspectives on institutional trust that were heretofore unknown , as well as what actions might violate that trust ."
Research findings/conclusions	Institutions must balance their desire to implement LA with their obligation to educate students about their analytic practices and treat them as partners in the design of analytic strategies reliant on student data in order to protect their intellectual privacy .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It remains unclear what their ( relative ) importance is .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three different models have been identified : ( a ) an exclusively accessibility-driven model , ( b ) a cost-benefit model in which both accessibility and quality are significant influences , and ( c ) an exclusively quality-driven model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , the conditions under which accessibility and quality are important are not well understood ."
Research questions	The goal of our study is to shed more light on both issues by assessing the role of different dimensions of accessibility and quality and how their importance is affected by time pressure .
Research method	We conducted a policy-capturing study in which 89 financial specialists participated .
Research method	"Each judged 20 scenarios in which the accessibility and quality of human information sources , as well as time pressure , were manipulated ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results showed that both accessibility and quality affect the likelihood of asking a human information source for information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , although the weights attached to physical accessibility and the source 's perceived technical quality were indeed moderated by time pressure , in both conditions we find support for a cost-benefit model of information seeking , in which both accessibility and quality are significant influences ."
Research questions	"Although the topic has been of perennial interest to information professionals and others , since at the least the early 1980s , we believe that it is timely to revisit this question in the context of a more connected and networked environment of data , information , and knowledge ."
Research questions	"The principal argument is that existing models of information exchange and use do not sufficiently take account of the multiplicity of networked users as a source of value , for example , their implicit and explicit interactions with other users , and with the information system ."
Research questions	"We briefly review existing kinds of value that have been theorized , operationalized , and measured in the information science literature ."
Research questions	"Principally , these are the notions of information as embedded value ; and information and information systems as adding value ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	To these notions we add the further notion of connected or cocreated value .
Research method	We conclude our opinion article with a set of questions intended to orient future research into the question of the value of information in the contemporary era .
Research findings/conclusions	"A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making , especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people , institutions and laboratories ."
Research questions	"Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy , however , remains a challenge ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse , and the results of those studies , although useful , have not been definitive ."
Research method	"In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation , bibliographic coupling , and co-citation ."
Research findings/conclusions	Using a set of new gold standards-articles with at least 100 references- we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters , direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies , and recommend against their use ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Rather than the existing project-centric prediction methods , we propose a novel backer-centric prediction method ."
Research method	We identify each backer 's preferences based on their pledge history and calculate the cosine similarity between backer 's preferences and the project as each backer 's persuasibility .
Research method	"Finally , we aggregate all the backers ' persuasibility to predict project success ."
Research method	"To validate our method , we crawled data on 183,886 projects launched during or before December 2014 on Kickstarter , a crowdfunding website ."
Research method	"We selected 4,922 backers with a total of 442,793 pledges to identify backers ' preferences ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that a backer is more likely to be persuaded by a project that is more similar to the backer 's preferences .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our Research findings/conclusions not only demonstrate the efficacy of backers ' pledge history for predicting crowdfunding project success but also verify that a backer-centric method can supplement the existing project-centric approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our model and Research findings/conclusions enable crowdfunding platform agencies , fund-seeking entrepreneurs , and investors to predict the success of a crowdfunding project ."
Research findings/conclusions	The selection of friends or followees responds to several reasons whose importance might differ according to the characteristics and preferences of each user .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , those preferences might also change over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Consequently , understanding how friends or followees are selected emerges as a key design factor of strategies for personalized recommendations ."
Research questions	"In this work , we argue that the criteria for recommending followees needs to be adapted and combined according to each user 's behavior , preferences , and characteristics ."
Research method	A method is proposed for adapting such criteria to the characteristics of the previously selected followees .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the criteria can evolve over time to adapt to changes in user behavior , and broaden the diversity of the recommendation of potential followees based on novelty ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method improved precision results regarding static criteria weighting strategies and traditional rank aggregation techniques .
Research questions	"Thus , understanding people 's illness representations can be invaluable when assisting them to develop lifestyle modifications that improve their health ."
Research questions	What role does information use play in this equation ?
Research value/outlook/limitations	This is the crucial question addressed by this two-part study .
Research method	"Part 1 hypothesizes a model of how information use at different timepoints may affect illness representations , and then tests this model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study found that a number of information use type and time pairings ( e.g. , information used to consult healthcare practitioners at symptom onset ) were significantly associated with present-day level of personal control ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that it is not merely type or timing of information use alone that is helpful in illness coping , but the coupling of the two ; this has several implications for the design of patient education programs ."
Research questions	Part 2 examines how information use and illness representations differ based on the way an individual participates in online health forums and social media sites .
Research findings/conclusions	"The following four different participation styles were investigated : nonuser , only reading ( lurker ) , posting occasionally but largely reading ( infrequent poster ) , and reading and posting ( poster ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Differences in both information use and illness perceptions were found , and the implications of these are discussed ."
Research questions	"In spite of the current widespread practice of information creation by young people , little research exists to illuminate how youth are engaged in creative information behavior or how they make participatory contributions to the changing information world ."
Research method	"The Research questionsfully selected sample includes teenagers who actively produce and share information projects , such as online school magazines , an information-sharing website in Wiki , and a digital media library , using Scratch-a graphical programming language developed by MIT Media Lab ."
Research method	Qualitative data were collected through group and individual interviews informed by Dervin 's Sense-Making Methodology .
Research method	The data analysis technique included directed qualitative content analysis with Atlas.ti .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions reveal the process of information creation , including content development , organization , and presentation of information , as well as noticeable patterns by youth such as visualizing , remixing , tinkering , and gaining a sense of empowerment ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study extends our knowledge of the creative aspects of information behavior .
Research questions	The disparity between referees ' opinions on the same paper typically makes it difficult to judge the paper 's quality .
Research method	"This article presents a comprehensive study of peer review biases with regard to 2 aspects of referees : the static profiles ( factual authority and self-reported confidence ) and the dynamic behavioral context ( the temporal ordering of reviews by a single reviewer ) , exploiting anonymized , real-world review reports of 2 different international conferences in information systems / computer science ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our work extends conventional bias research by considering multiple biases occurring simultaneously .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions show that the referees ' static profiles are more dominant in peer review bias when compared to their dynamic behavioral context .
Research findings/conclusions	"Of the static profiles , self-reported confidence improved both conference fitness and impact-based bias reductions , while factual authority could only contribute to conference fitness-based bias reduction ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results also clearly show that the reliability of referees ' judgments varies along their static profiles and is contingent on the temporal interval between 2 consecutive reviews .
Research method	The mechanism is simple to apply and adjusts for metric magnitude differentials and distributional asymmetries in the rank-score curves .
Research method	"The method is demonstrated using h-index , AWCR-index , g-index , and e-index data from journals in Accounting , Economics , and Finance ."
Research questions	They argue that work is actually a huge part of life .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the mind-set of these scientists , weekdays and weekends are equally appropriate for working on their research ."
Research questions	"Although we all have encountered such people , we may wonder how widespread this condition is with other scientists in our field ."
Research method	This brief communication probes work-life balance issues among JASIST authors and editors .
Research method	"We collected and examined the publication histories for 1,533 of the 2,402 articles published in JASIST between 2001 and 2012 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there is no rush to submit , revise , or accept papers , we found that 11 % of these events happened during weekends and that this trend has been increasing since 2005 ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that working during the weekend may be one of the ways that scientists cope with the highly demanding era of publish or perish .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We hope that our Research findings/conclusions will raise an awareness of the steady increases in work among scientists before it affects our work-life balance even more .
Research method	In-text author citation analysis refers to author-based citation analysis using in-text citation data from full-text articles rather than reference data from citation databases .
Research findings/conclusions	It has the potential to help with the application of citation analysis to research fields such as the social sciences that are not covered well by citation databases and to support weighted citation and cocitation counting for improved citation analysis results .
Research findings/conclusions	We found that in-text author citation analysis can work as well as traditional citation analysis using citation databases for both author ranking and mapping if author name disambiguation is performed properly .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using in-text citation data without any author name disambiguation , ranking authors by citations is useless , whereas cocitation analysis works well for identifying major specialties and their interrelationships with cautions required for the interpretation of small research areas and some authors ' memberships in specialties ."
Research method	This article investigates the citation impact and Mendeley readership impact of biochemistry research from 2011 in the Web of Science according to the type of collaboration involved .
Research method	"Negative binomial regression models are used that incorporate , for the first time , the inclusion of specific countries within a team ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that , holding other factors constant , larger teams robustly associate with higher impact research , but including additional departments has no effect and adding extra institutions tends to reduce the impact of research ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although international collaboration is apparently not advantageous in general , collaboration with the United States , and perhaps also with some other countries , seems to increase impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , collaborations with some other nations seems to decrease impact , although both Research findings/conclusions could be due to factors such as differing national proportions of excellent researchers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As a methodological implication , simpler statistical models would find international collaboration to be generally beneficial and so it is important to take into account specific countries when examining collaboration ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We studied this phenomenon in the field of scholarly publishing from the perspective of a single author .
Research method	"We examined 1,024 such spam e-mails received by Marcin Kozak from publishers and journals over a period of 391 days , asking him to submit an article to their journal ."
Research method	We collected the following information : where the request came from ; publishing model applied ; fees charged ; inclusion or not in the Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) ; and presence or not in Beall 's ( 2014 ) listing of dubious journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our research showed that most of the publishers that sent e-mails inviting manuscripts were ( i ) using the open access model , ( ii ) using article-processing charges to fund their journal 's operations ; ( iii ) offering very short peer-review times , ( iv ) on Beall 's list , and ( v ) misrepresenting the location of their headquarters ."
Research questions	"Some years ago , a letter of invitation to submit an article to a particular journal was considered a kind of distinction ."
Research questions	"Today , e-mails inviting submissions are generally spam , something that misleads young researchers and irritates experienced ones ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Even so , it has rarely been investigated in the online health community ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we focus on the multichannel access in online health communities , defining social influence as the average degree of multichannel access to a physician 's colleagues ."
Research method	"Based on the multinomial logistic regression model , we examined the direct effects of social influence and patients ' rating to multichannel access ."
Research questions	"In addition , we explored the moderating effect of social influence on the relationship between patients ' rating and multichannel access in online health communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the experiment and robustness testing support the propositions that social influence and patients ' rating significantly and positively affect multichannel access in an online health community .
Research findings/conclusions	The moderating effect of social influence is negative and significantly influences the accessible channels provided by the focal physician .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research contributes to the literature concerning online health communities , social influence , and multichannel access ; it also has practical implications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"or an institutional one ( e.g. , @ wsiz.rzeszow.pl , @ medicine.ox.ac.uk ) as an address for correspondence is an important aspect of scientific communication ."
Research questions	"Some authors consider that public e-mail services are unprofessional and insecure , whereas others say that , in a dynamically changing working environment , public e-mail addresses allow readers to contact authors long after they have changed their workplace ."
Research method	"To shed light on this issue , we analyzed how often authors of scientific papers provided e-mail addresses that were either public or institution based ."
Research method	"We selected from the Web of Science database 1,000 frequently cited and 1,000 infrequently cited articles ( all of the latter were noncited articles ) published in 2000 , 2005 , and 2010 , and from these we analyzed 26,937 e-mail addresses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that approximately three fourths of these addresses were institutional , but there was an increasing trend toward using public e-mail addresses over the period studied ."
Research findings/conclusions	No significant differences were found between frequently and infrequently cited papers in this respect .
Research findings/conclusions	Further research is now needed to access the motivations and perceptions of scholars when it comes to their use of either public or institutional e-mail accounts .
Research questions	We examine whether and to what extent their search efficiency is affected by their language skills .
Research method	"Our task-oriented approach focuses on three stages of the information retrieval process : need articulation , query formulation , and relevance judgment ."
Research method	"The test participants completed a pretest questionnaire , which gave us information about their overall experience with the search system and their self-reported computer and language skills ."
Research method	The students were briefly introduced to the use of PubMed and MeSH ( medical subject headings ) before they conducted their keyword-driven subject search .
Research method	"We assessed the search results in terms of recall and precision , and also analyzed the search process ."
Research method	"After the search task , a satisfaction survey and a language test were completed ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that language skills have an impact on the search results .
Research questions	We hypothesize that language support might improve the efficiency of searches conducted by Dutch-speaking users of PubMed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we offer an ( almost ) unsupervised method for solving this problem with surprisingly high accuracy ."
Research questions	The main idea is to use repeated feature subsampling methods to determine if one document of the pair allows us to select the other from among a background set of impostors in a sufficiently robust manner .
Research questions	"To explain this phenomenon , we use the lens of the calculus of behavior within a cost-benefit framework suggesting privacy concerns as cost factors and behavior enticements as benefit factors and examine how the enticements operate against privacy concerns in users ' cost-benefit calculus regarding disclosing personal information and using SNS continuously ."
Research questions	"Adopting social influence process theory , we examine three enticementsthe motivation of relationship management through SNS , the perceived usefulness of SNS for self-presentation , and the subjective social norms of using SNS ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From a survey of 362 Facebook users who have disclosed personal information on Facebook , we find that the motivation of relationship management through SNS and the perceived usefulness of SNS for self-presentation lead users to disclose information but that subjective social norms do not , suggesting that the perceived benefit of behavior enticements should be assimilated into users ' own value systems to truly operate as benefit factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results regarding the positive and negative effects of suggested benefit and cost factors on information disclosure show that only the combined positive effects of all three behavior enticements exceed the negative effect of privacy concerns , suggesting that privacy concerns can be offset only by multiple benefit factors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous international comparisons of news interests have tended to use surveys and may bypass topics not well covered in the mainstream media .
Research method	"This study uses 9 months of English-language Tweets from the United Kingdom , United States , India , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based upon the top 50 trending keywords in each country from the 0.5 billion Tweets collected , festivals or religious events are the most common , followed by media events , politics , human interest , and sports ."
Research findings/conclusions	U.S. trending topics have the most interest in the other countries and Indian trending topics the least .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , India is the most interested in other countries trending topics and the United States the least ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This gives evidence of an international hierarchy of perceived importance or relevance with some issues , such as the international interest in U.S. Thanksgiving celebrations , apparently not being directly driven by the media ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This hierarchy echoes , and may be caused by , similar news coverage trends ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the current imbalanced international news coverage does not seem to be out of step with public news interests , the political implication is that the Twitter-using public reflects , and hence seems to implicitly accept , international imbalances in news media agenda setting rather than combating them ."
Research questions	This is an issue for those believing that these imbalances make the media too powerful .
Research findings/conclusions	"Extensive documents are more likely to have low cohesion among their various sections , which may lead the reader to perceive the information as being of low quality ."
Research questions	"This research addresses this issue by presenting a tool ( Text Matrix ) composed of procedures and algorithms coded in software , with the aim of analyzing cohesion between the text sections in extensive documents ."
Research method	"A design science research approach was applied to develop , test , and prove the usefulness of the Text Matrix ."
Research method	A total of 127 academic advisors and advisees were trained to use the Text Matrix and apply it in the development of the extensive text of dissertations .
Research findings/conclusions	An analysis both of those users ' perceptions and of variations in network density among 41 extensive texts that they improved through the analyses performed by the artifact proposed in the present study demonstrated the ease of operation and effectiveness of the Text Matrix to identify parts of extensive texts associated with cohesion failures that could be connected by cohesion devices or even excluded from the extensive text .
Research questions	"Different from general-Research questions content-based image retrieval ( CBIR ) applications , the specific goal of product image search is to retrieve and rank relevant products from a large-scale product database to visually assist a user 's online shopping experience ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we explore the problem of product image search through salient edge characterization and analysis , for which we propose a novel image search method coupled with an interactive user region-of-interest indication function ."
Research method	"Given a product image , the proposed approach first extracts an edge map , based on which contour curves are further extracted ."
Research method	We then segment the extracted contours into fragments according to the detected contour corners .
Research method	"After that , a set of salient edge elements is extracted from each product image ."
Research method	"Based on salient edge elements matching and similarity evaluation , the method derives a new pairwise image similarity estimate ."
Research method	"Using the new image similarity , we can then retrieve product images ."
Research method	"To evaluate the performance of our algorithm , we conducted 120 sessions of querying experiments on a data set comprised of around 13k product images collected from multiple , real-world e-commerce websites ."
Research method	"We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of a bag-of-words method ( Philbin , Chum , Isard , Sivic , & Zisserman , 2008 ) and a Pyramid Histogram of Orientated Gradients ( PHOG ) method ( Bosch , Zisserman , & Munoz , 2007 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of example-based product image retrieval .
Research method	"Considering the time factor , we adopt the methodology of Granger causality test and track 3,390 products on Amazon.com over a 2-month period ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results reveal that a causality loop exists between online consumer review volume and sales .
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , our Research findings/conclusions indicate that the volume of negative consumer reviews drive consumers ' purchasing decisions , but the volume of positive consumers reviews only marginally affects purchasing decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , consumers generate more positive reviews than negative reviews after sales ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results highlight the importance of negative consumer reviews ; negative reviews not only lead to sales , but sales , in turn , lead to higher volume of negative reviews ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions suggest an alternative strategy for practitioners to address negative online consumer reviews and highlight the awareness effect of online consumer review postings that can later convert into purchase behaviors .
Research questions	"This review will attempt to put The Great Hack in its historical , political , and technical context , and will try to answer the question : How dangerous was Cambridge Analytica ?"
Research findings/conclusions	"The documentary claims the technology is to some considerable degree dangerous , although perhaps less dangerous than those involved with Cambridge Analytica like to think ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The film is certainly worth viewing , as long as the viewer remembers that it is good journalism , but not a scholarly analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	Automatic identification of disease aspect information is thus essential .
Research questions	"In this article , I model the aspect identification problem as a text classification ( TC ) problem in which a disease aspect corresponds to a category ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The disease aspect classification problem poses two challenges to classifiers : ( a ) a medical text often contains information about multiple aspects of a disease and hence produces noise for the classifiers and ( b ) text classifiers often can not extract the textual parts ( i.e. , passages ) about the categories of interest ."
Research questions	"I thus develop a technique , PETC ( Passage Extractor for Text Classification ) , that extracts passages ( from medical texts ) for the underlying text classifiers to classify ."
Research findings/conclusions	Case studies on thousands of Chinese and English medical texts show that PETC enhances a support vector machine ( SVM ) classifier in classifying disease aspect information .
Research findings/conclusions	"PETC also performs better than three state-of-the-art classifier enhancement techniques , including two passage extraction techniques for text classifiers and a technique that employs term proximity information to enhance text classifiers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The contribution is of significance to evidence-based medicine , health education , and healthcare decision support ."
Research findings/conclusions	PETC can be used in those application domains in which a text to be classified may have several parts about different categories .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is a generalization of the theory of discovering usability problems .
Research findings/conclusions	"We prove that , in all practical cases , this fraction is a concave function of n , the number of used databases , thereby explaining some graphs that exist in the literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also study limiting features of this fraction for n very high and we characterize the case that we find all literature on a certain topic for n high enough .
Research questions	"But online content can be misused for the distribution of illicit information , such as violent postings in web forums ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Illicit content is highly distributed in social media , while non-illicit content is unspecific and topically diverse ."
Research questions	It is costly and time consuming to label a large amount of illicit content ( positive examples ) and non-illicit content ( negative examples ) to train classification systems .
Research questions	"Nevertheless , it is relatively easy to obtain large volumes of unlabeled content in social media ."
Research questions	"In this article , an artificial immune system-based technique is presented to address the difficulties in the illicit content identification in social media ."
Research method	"Inspired by the positive selection principle in the immune system , we designed a novel labeling heuristic based on partially supervised learning to extract high-quality positive and negative examples from unlabeled datasets ."
Research findings/conclusions	The empirical evaluation results from two large hate group web forums suggest that our proposed approach generally outperforms the benchmark techniques and exhibits more stable performance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This framework could be considered the next generation of citation analysis .
Research method	The authors briefly review the history and features of content analysis in traditional social sciences and its previous application in library and information science ( LIS ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on critical discussion of the theoretical necessity of a new method as well as the limits of citation analysis , the nature and Research questionss of CCA are discussed , and potential procedures to conduct CCA , including principles to identify the reference scope , a two-dimensional ( citing and cited ) and two-module ( syntactic and semantic ) codebook , are provided and described ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Future work and implications are also suggested .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Better organizing and preserving these materials will not only enrich our understanding of the history of these media but also educate and inspire the next generation of video game creators .
Research questions	This research aims to improve our theoretical understanding of how to organize and represent game development artifacts by examining the various types of artifacts created and their attendant issues and challenges .
Research method	"We adopted a multimethod approach employing an examination of existing collections and 29 interviews with creators , information professionals , and game researchers ."
Research method	"From these data , we analyze the current practices , expressed values , and perceived challenges of these stakeholders , produce a taxonomy of game development artifacts , and provide best practices recommendations for describing them ."
Research method	"In this work , we conducted a survey of 41 lung cancer patients at an outpatient lung cancer clinic at the medical center of the University of California , Los Angeles , to gain insight into these perceived information needs and opinions on the design of a portal to fulfill them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that patients requested access to information related to diagnosis and imaging , with more than half of the patients reporting that they did not anticipate an increase in anxiety due to access to medical record information via a portal ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also found that patient educational background did not lead to a significant difference in desires for explanations of reports and definitions of terms .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the research Research findings/conclusions are that many different methods will work , including a number of methods that are superficially language-independent ( such as an analysis of the most common words or character n-grams in a document ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Since all languages have words ( and all written languages have characters ) , this method could ( in theory ) work on any language ."
Research questions	"However , it is not clear that the methods that work best on , for example English , would also work best on other languages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is not even clear that the same level of performance is achievable in different languages , even under identical conditions ."
Research questions	"Unfortunately , it is very difficult to achieve identical conditions in practice ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A new corpus , developed by George Mikros , provides very tight controls not only for author but also for topic , thus enabling a direct comparison of performance levels between the two languages Greek and English ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We compare a number of different methods head-to-head on this corpus , and show that , overall , performance on English is higher than performance on Greek , often highly significantly so ."
Research questions	We used this opportunity to analyze how the event affected the social-networking community of Twitter .
Research method	We analyzed whether the flyby of the asteroid elicited more tweets about the asteroid close to the asteroid 's trajectory compared to the neutral search term NASA .
Research findings/conclusions	"A spatio-temporal analysis of tweets about NASA revealed a natural movement of the geographical mean from east to west , mirroring the Sun 's path through the sky ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the geolocation of users tweeting about the asteroid , this east-west movement changed direction , mirroring the asteroid 's trajectory ( from south-east to north-west ) as soon as the asteroid was potentially visible from Earth ."
Research findings/conclusions	This effect appears to represent emotionally contagious flocking behavior among Twitter users influenced by the position of the asteroid itself .
Research questions	"In this review , I will provide a brief overview of LBD , both past and present , and will propose some new directions for the next decade ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The prevalent ABC model is not wrong ; however , it is only one of several different types of models that can contribute to the development of the next generation of LBD tools ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Perhaps the most urgent need is to develop a series of objective literature-based interestingness measures , which can customize the output of LBD systems for different types of scientific investigations ."
Research method	The topic relevance model uses event-related potential ( ERP ) components to describe the process of topic relevance judgment .
Research findings/conclusions	"More specifically , the topic relevance model indicates that N400 and P600 , which have been successfully applied to the mismatch process of a stimulus and the discourse-internal reorganization and integration process of a stimulus , respectively , are used for the topic mismatch process of a topic-irrelevant video shot and the topic formation process of a topic-relevant video shot ."
Research method	"To evaluate our proposed ERP/MMR-based method , we compared the video skims generated by the ERP/MMR-based , ERP-based , and shot boundary detection ( SBD ) methods with ground truth skims ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that at a significance level of 0.05 , the ROUGE-1 scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the SBD method , and the diversity scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the ERP method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study suggested that the proposed method may be applied to the construction of a video skim without operational intervention , such as the insertion of a black screen between video shots ."
Research method	Main path analysis is a bibliometric method capable of tracing the most significant paths in a citation network and is commonly used to trace the development trajectory of a research field .
Research findings/conclusions	"We highlight several limitations of the original main path analysis and suggest new , complementary approaches to overcome these limitations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast to the original local main path , the new approaches generate the global main path , the backward local main path , multiple main paths , and key-route main paths ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Each of them is obtained via a perspective different from the original approach .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By simultaneously conducting the new , complementary approaches , one uncovers the key development of the target discipline from a broader view ."
Research method	"To demonstrate the value of these new approaches , we simultaneously apply them to a set of academic articles related to the Hirsch index ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that the integrated approach discovers several paths that are not captured by the original approach .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Among these new approaches , the key-route approach is especially useful and hints at a divergence-convergence-divergence structure in the development of the Hirsch index ."
Research questions	"To understand this possible shift from reading print media to reading digital media , we investigated reading behavior for 11 media and reading preferences between print and digital in different circumstances ."
Research method	"In August 2012 , an online survey was used to inquire about the reading behavior and preference of 1,755 participants , ranging in age from 18 to 69 years ."
Research findings/conclusions	The participants contained equal numbers of men and women from five age brackets .
Research findings/conclusions	Our main finding was that approximately 70 % of total reading time was spent on digital media and that preferences favored print media .
Research method	"Cluster analysis of reading time by media was used to categorize respondents into eight clusters , and a second cluster analysis on stated preference ( digital or print ) yielded six clusters ."
Research findings/conclusions	The correspondence analysis between reading behavior clusters and preference clusters revealed that there is a mismatch between reading behavior and stated preference for either print or digital media .
Research findings/conclusions	"This study presents a framework for discovering story chains , given an input document , in a text collection ."
Research method	"The framework has 3 complementary parts that i ) scan the collection , ii ) measure the similarity between chain-member candidates and the chain , and iii ) measure similarity among news articles ."
Research method	"For scanning , we apply a novel text-mining method that uses a zigzagged search that reinvestigates past documents based on the updated chain ."
Research method	We also utilize social networks of news actors to reveal connections among news articles .
Research method	"We conduct 2 user studies in terms of 4 effectiveness measures-relevance , coverage , coherence , and ability to disclose relations ."
Research method	"The first user study compares several versions of the framework , by varying parameters , to set a guideline for use ."
Research method	The second compares the framework with 3 baselines .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that our method provides statistically significant improvement in effectiveness in 61 % of pairwise comparisons , with medium or large effect size ; in the remainder , none of the baselines significantly outperforms our method ."
Research questions	"However , prior studies focused mostly on the relationship between aggregated online reviews and sales ."
Research questions	"This paper investigates the impact of online review richness ( i.e. , reviews containing videos or follow-on reviews ) on sales ."
Research questions	"Leveraging attribute substitution theory , we conjecture that online review richness can provide heuristic cues in the online shopping environment to help consumers make better purchase decisions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using data from , we found that reviews containing either videos or follow-on reviews positively affect sales ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , different product types can also serve as heuristic cues to replace target cues , which can further affect how different forms of online review richness affect sales ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that the impact of online review richness on sales is stronger for utilitarian products than for hedonic products , and stronger for negatively commented products than for positively commented products ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we conducted two online experiments and confirmed that the causal relationship is from online review richness to sales ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The research Research findings/conclusions offer practical implications for online retailers and constitute one of the first steps toward a better understanding of the relationship between online review richness and sales .
Research method	Fifty topics in arXiv and WoS were generated using an LDA algorithm and then regression models were used to explain 4 types of topic growth patterns .
Research method	"Based on the slopes of the fitted equation curves , the paper redefines the topic trends and popularity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that arXiv and WoS share similar topics in a given domain , but differ in evolution trends ."
Research findings/conclusions	Topics in WoS lose their popularity much earlier and their durations of popularity are shorter than those in arXiv .
Research findings/conclusions	This work demonstrates that open access preprints have stronger growth tendency as compared to traditional printed publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"Society can reap the benefits of successful research studies only if the results are converted into marketable and consumable products ( e.g. , medicaments , diagnostic tools , machines , and devices ) or services ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A series of different names have been introduced which refer to the societal impact of research : third stream activities , societal benefits , societal quality , usefulness , public values , knowledge transfer , and societal relevance ."
Research questions	"What most of these names are concerned with is the assessment of social , cultural , environmental , and economic returns ( impact and effects ) from results ( research output ) or products ( research outcome ) of publicly funded research ."
Research questions	This review intends to present existing research on and practices employed in the assessment of societal impact in the form of a literature survey .
Research questions	The objective is for this review to serve as a basis for the development of robust and reliable methods of societal impact measurement .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While much research has focused on the concerns of younger generations , few studies have investigated older adults , specifically those aged 65+ years ."
Research method	"This study analyzes in-depth interviews with 40 older adults living in East York , Toronto , Canada , to investigate their online privacy concerns and the strategies they use to mitigate these concerns ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that East York older adults are mostly concerned about security privacy concerns followed by institutional privacy concerns and only minimally concerned about social privacy .
Research findings/conclusions	The greatest concerns included information misuse by unknown others and unauthorized access to their personal information .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that , for some older adults , their high privacy concerns precluded them from taking full advantage of the potential benefits of digital media ."
Research findings/conclusions	"East York older adults varied considerably in their use of privacy protection strategies ; some older adults used no strategies , while others were eager to protect their privacy using all strategies at their disposal ."
Research method	"In a field study , we examined how students ' search effort for an assigned learning task was associated with precision and relative recall , and how this was associated to the quality of learning outcome ."
Research method	The study subjects were 41 medical students writing essays for a class in medicine .
Research method	Searching in Medline was part of their assignment .
Research method	"The data comprised students ' search logs in Medline , their assessment of the usefulness of references retrieved , a questionnaire concerning the search process , and evaluation scores of the essays given by the teachers ."
Research method	Pearson correlation was calculated for answering the research questions .
Research method	"Finally , a path model for predicting task outcome was built ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that effort in the search process degraded precision but improved task outcome .
Research findings/conclusions	There were two major mechanisms reducing precision while enhancing task outcome .
Research findings/conclusions	"Effort in expanding Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) terms within search sessions and effort in assessing and exploring documents in the result list between the sessions degraded precision , but led to better task outcome ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , human effort compensated bad retrieval results on the way to good task outcome ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions suggest that traditional effectiveness measures in information retrieval should be complemented with evaluation measures for search process and outcome .
Research method	"In PRF , the top-k retrieved images are regarded as PRF ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the PRF set contains noise , PRF has proven effective for automatically improving the overall retrieval result ."
Research method	"To implement PRF , the Rocchio algorithm has been considered as a reasonable and well-established baseline ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the performance of Rocchio-based PRF is subject to various representation choices ( or factors ) ."
Research questions	"In this article , we examine these factors that affect the performance of Rocchio-based PRF , including image-feature representation , the number of top-ranked images , the weighting parameters of Rocchio , and similarity measure ."
Research findings/conclusions	We offer practical insights on how to optimize the performance of Rocchio-based PRF by choosing appropriate representation choices .
Research findings/conclusions	Our extensive experiments on NUS-WIDE-LITE and Caltech 101+Corel 5000 data sets show that the optimal feature representation is color moment+wavelet texture in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness .
Research findings/conclusions	"Other representation choices are that using top-20 ranked images as pseudopositive and pseudonegative feedback sets with the equal weight ( i.e. , 0.5 ) by the correlation and cosine distance functions can produce the optimal retrieval result ."
Research questions	"It is argued that the notion of information quality is of great importance , and needs to be situated better within a sound philosophy of information to help frame information quality in a broader conceptual light ."
Research questions	"It is found that much research on information quality conceptualizes information quality as either an inherent property of the information itself , or as an individual mental construct of the users ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The notion of information quality is often not situated within a philosophy of information .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper outlines a conceptual framework in which information is regarded as a semiotic sign , and extends that notion with Paul Grice 's pragmatic philosophy of language to provide a conversational notion of information quality that is contextual and tied to the notion of meaning ."
Research questions	It becomes a reality when individuals simply conform to the majority opinion and hesitate to suggest their own solutions to a problem .
Research questions	"Anonymity has long been established to have an effect on conformity , but no previous research has explored the effects of different anonymity states in relation to an individual 's likelihood to conform ."
Research method	"Through a survey of randomly chosen participants from the English-language Wikipedia community , I explored the effects of anonymity on the likelihood of conforming to group opinion ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , I differentiated between actual states of anonymity and individuals ' perceptions of anonymity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"His Research findings/conclusions indicate that although people perceive anonymity differently depending on their anonymity state , different states of anonymity do not have a strong effect on the likelihood of conforming to group opinion ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on this evidence , I make recommendations for software engineers who have a direct hand in the design of online community platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In many cases , statistic information ( for example , users ' profiles ) and sequentially dynamic information ( for example , logs of interaction with information systems ) are two prominent sources that can be combined to achieve optimized results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous attempts in combining these two sources mainly exploited models designed for either static or sequential information , but not both ."
Research questions	This study aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel joint neural network model that can naturally fit both static and sequential user data .
Research method	"To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method , this study uses the problem of at-risk student prediction as an example where both static data ( personal profiles ) and sequential data ( event logs ) are involved ."
Research method	"A thorough evaluation was conducted on an open data set , with comparisons to a range of existing approaches including both static and sequential models ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results reveal superb performances of the proposed method .
Research findings/conclusions	Implications of the Research findings/conclusions on further research and applications of joint models are discussed .
Research questions	"One of the major limitations in today 's plagiarism checkers is their sole dependence on text-based detection , where they ignore the citation and structural information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , the text-based detection approaches that they employ usually fail to trace out intelligent manipulations ."
Research method	"In the proposed work , a plagiarism detection system is presented that employs the effective coupling of various modules , namely , logical structure classifications and citation parsing , two-stage candidate document selections , syntax-semantic-based exhaustive passage level analysis with plagiarism analysis using structural and citation information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , a new plagiarism score , namely , weighted overall similarity index is proposed , opposed to the general plagiarism scores ."
Research method	The proposed approach is evaluated on the data set created by Alzahrani et al .
Research method	"( ) , which contains scientific publications imposed with various plagiarism complexities ."
Research method	Comparison of the final system results is done against a potential baseline approach .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The proposed approach exhibits considerable improvement over the comparative baseline , and hence reflects the potency of syntax-semantic text-based analysis with structural and citation information ."
Research questions	This article studies how badge design affects people 's contributions and behavior over time .
Research questions	"Past work has shown that badges steer people 's behavior toward substantially increasing the amount of contributions before obtaining the badge , and immediately decreasing their contributions thereafter , returning to their baseline contribution levels ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , we find that the steering effect depends on the type of user , as modeled by the rate and intensity of the user 's contributions ."
Research method	"We use these measures to distinguish between different groups of user activity , including users who are not affected by the badge system despite being significant contributors to the site ."
Research findings/conclusions	We provide a predictive model of how users change their activity group over the course of their lifetime in the system .
Research method	"We demonstrate our approach empirically in three different Q & A sites on Stack Exchange with hundreds of thousands of users , for two types of activities ( editing and voting on posts ) ."
Research questions	"In this article , we address more specifically the problem of accessing relevant entities , such as publications and authors within a bibliographic network , given an information need ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We propose a novel algorithm , called BibRank , that estimates a joint relevance of documents and authors within a bibliographic network ."
Research method	This model ranks each type of entity using a score propagation algorithm with respect to the query topic and the structure of the underlying bi-type information entity network .
Research method	"Evidence sources , namely content-based and network-based scores , are both used to estimate the topical similarity between connected entities ."
Research method	"For this Research questions , authorship relationships are analyzed through a language model-based score on the one hand and on the other hand , non topically related entities of the same type are detected through marginal citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The article reports the results of experiments using the Bibrank algorithm for an information retrieval task .
Research method	The CiteSeerX bibliographic data set forms the basis for the topical query automatic generation and evaluation .
Research findings/conclusions	We show that a statistically significant improvement over closely related ranking models is achieved .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The use of digital traces to provide insight into human behavior remains underdeveloped .
Research questions	"Recently , ontological approaches have been exploited for tagging and linking digital traces , with progress made in ontology models for well-defined domains ."
Research questions	"However , the process of conceptualization for ill-defined domains remains challenging , requiring interdisciplinary efforts to understand the main aspects and capture them in a computer processable form ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The primary contribution of this article is a theory-driven approach to ontology development that supports semantic augmentation of digital traces .
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , we argue that ( a ) activity theory can be used to develop more insightful conceptual models of ill-defined activities , which ( b ) can be used to inform the development of an ontology , and ( c ) that this ontology can be used to guide the semantic augmentation of digital traces for making sense of phenomena ."
Research method	A case study of interpersonal communication is chosen to illustrate the applicability of the proposed multidisciplinary approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"The benefits of the approach are illustrated through an example application , demonstrating how it may be used to assemble and make sense of digital traces ."
Research method	"The individuals are classified into 3 cohorts according to their manifested professional recognition , as Price medalists ( Pm ) , members of the editorial board of Scientometrics and the Journal of Informetrics ( Rw ) , and session chairs ( Sc ) at an International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics ( ISSI ) conference ."
Research method	"Several core impact indicators are calculated : h , g , pi , citation distribution score ( CDS ) , percentage rank position ( PRP ) , and weight of influence of papers ( WIP10 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The indices significantly correlate with each other .
Research findings/conclusions	The mean value of the indices of the cohorts decreases parallel with the decrease in professional recognition : Pm > Rw > Sc .
Research method	The 30 scientometricians studied were clustered according to the core impact indices .
Research findings/conclusions	The members in the clusters so obtained overlap only partly with the members in the cohorts made by professional recognition .
Research method	"The Total Overlap is calculated by dividing the sum of the diagonal elements in the cohorts-clusters matrix with the total number of elements , times 100 ."
Research findings/conclusions	The highest overlap ( 76.6 % ) was obtained with the g-index .
Research findings/conclusions	"Accordingly , the g-index seems to have the greatest discriminative power in the system studied ."
Research findings/conclusions	The cohorts-clusters method may be used for validating scientometric indicators .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We study this question empirically , as opposed to normatively ."
Research method	"Based on the literature that discusses whose viewpoints should be reflected , we construct a research model that includes those same three viewpoints as factors that might be influencing term assignment in actual practice ."
Research method	"In the unique study design that we employ , the records of term assignments made by identified indexers in academic libraries are cross-referenced with the results of a survey that those same indexers completed on political views ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results indicate that in our setting , variance in term assignment was best explained by indexers ' personal political views ."
Research method	( c ) 2019 ASIS & T
Research value/outlook/limitations	This offers the opportunity for a comparison between these 2 indices from a new perspective .
Research findings/conclusions	Personal communication networks as a feature do not exist in all collaborative projects .
Research questions	It is currently unclear if a designer 's decision to include a personal communication network in a collaborative project 's structure affects outcome quality .
Research questions	"In this study , I investigated Wikipedia 's personal communication network and analyzed which Wikipedia editors are utilizing it and how they are connected to outcome quality ."
Research findings/conclusions	Evidence suggests that people who utilize these networks are more experienced in editing high quality articles and are more integrated in the community .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , these individuals utilize the personal communication network for coordinating and perhaps mentoring editors who edit lower quality articles ."
Research questions	The value of these networks is demonstrated by the characteristics of the users who use them .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions indicate that designers of online collaborative projects can help improve the quality of outcomes in these projects by deciding to implement a personal communication network in their communities .
Research questions	"Since then , bibliometric analysis of funding acknowledgment ( FA ) has been growing and has aroused intense interest and attention from both academia and policy makers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Examining the distribution of FA by citation index database , by language , and by acknowledgment type , we noted coverage limitations and potential biases in each analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We argue that despite its great value , bibliometric analysis of FA should be used with caution ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Answers as a recent example of how public concerns regarding an international health issue are reflected in social media .
Research method	We investigate the contents of posts about the Zika virus on Yahoo !
Research method	"Answers , identify and reveal subject patterns about the Zika virus , and analyze the temporal changes of the revealed subject topics over 4 defined periods of the Zika virus outbreak ."
Research method	"Multidimensional scaling analysis , temporal analysis , and inferential statistical analysis approaches were used in the study ."
Research method	"A resulting 2-layer Zika virus schema , and term connections and relationships are presented ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicate that consumers ' concerns changed over the 4 defined periods .
Research findings/conclusions	"Consumers paid more attention to the basic information about the Zika virus , and the prevention and protection from the Zika virus at the beginning of the outbreak of the Zika virus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"During the later periods , consumers became more interested in the role that the government and health organizations played in the public health emergency ."
Research questions	"The work of Campanario and Coslado ( 2011 ) , however , shows that Benford 's law does not always fit practical data in a statistical sense ."
Research method	"In this article , we use a generalization of Benford 's law related to the general law of Zipf with exponent beta ? > ? 0 ."
Research method	"Using data from Campanario and Coslado , we apply nonlinear least squares to determine the optimal beta and show that this generalized law of Benford fits the data better than the classical law of Benford ."
Research questions	"At the same time , many health providers consider knowledge of the latest literature in their field a key component for successful clinical practice ."
Research questions	"In this work , we introduce two systems designed to help retrieving medical literature ."
Research method	"Both receive a long , discursive clinical note as input query , and return highly relevant literature that could be used in support of clinical practice ."
Research method	The first system is an improved version of a method previously proposed by the authors ; it combines pseudo relevance feedback and a domain-specific term filter to reformulate the query .
Research method	The second is an approach that uses a deep neural network to reformulate a clinical note .
Research findings/conclusions	"Both approaches were evaluated on the 2014 and 2015 TREC CDS datasets ; in our tests , they outperform the previously proposed method by up to 28 % in inferred NDCG ; furthermore , they are competitive with the state of the art , achieving up to 8 % improvement in inferred NDCG ."
Research method	An aboutness coefficient is developed to estimate the strength of the aboutness relationship .
Research method	Words that are randomly distributed across subjects are assumed to lack aboutness and the degree to which their usage deviates from a random pattern indicates the strength of the aboutness .
Research method	"To estimate aboutness , title words and their associated subjects are extracted from the titles of non-fiction English language books in the OCLC WorldCat database ."
Research method	The usage patterns of the title words are analyzed and used to compute aboutness coefficients for each of the common title words .
Research findings/conclusions	"Words with low aboutness coefficients ( An and In ) are commonly found in stop word lists , whereas words with high aboutness coefficients ( Carbonate , Autism ) are unambiguous and have a strong subject association ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The aboutness coefficient potentially can enhance indexing , advance authority control , and improve retrieval ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study provides a detailed comparison of use patterns between work and personal e-mail accounts .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results suggest that users engage in more keeping behaviors with work e-mail than with personal e-mailrespondents reported more frequent use of keeping actions and larger inbox sizes for their work accounts .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , we found correlations between individual respondents ' e-mail behaviors in the two contexts , indicating that personal preferences can play a role ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also report results pointing to e-mail as an important boundary management artifact .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show evidence that the use of multiple e-mail accounts may be a work-personal boundary placement strategy , but also observe that a fair amount of boundary permeation occurs through e-mail ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To our knowledge , this study is one of the first to compare e-mail use in both work and personal contexts across the same sample ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our Research findings/conclusions extend prior research on personal information management regarding e-mail use , and help inform the role of e-mail in managing work-personal boundaries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results have implications for the design of e-mail systems , organizational e-mail policies , user training , and understanding the impacts of technology on daily life ."
Research questions	"The present paper attempts to redress both and proposes that navigability be conceptually examined along three dimensions , namely , logic of structure , clarity of structure , and clarity of target ."
Research method	A 2x2x2 factorial between-subjects experiment ( N=128 ) was conducted to examine distinct contributions of these dimensions to perceptions of a nonprofit website .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed significant effects for logic of structure and clarity on perceived navigability , while logic of structure and content domain involvement affected attitudes toward the website ."
Research method	"Drawing from 95 structured interviews , 6 in-depth interviews , a focus group , and a series of participatory observations of computer training classes at Casa Latina , we find that information and communication technologies ( ICT ) help immigrant day laborers remain connected with their families and their employers and facilitate their navigation of , and integration into , the society in which they have precarious social and economic standing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"ICT help immigrant day laborers maintain links with their past and their roots , offer tools to navigate their present needs , and help them build future plans and aspirations ."
Research findings/conclusions	Hispanic day laborers experience ICT mostly through mobile phones used to communicate with employers and families ; they use computers and the Internet to communicate with family and friends .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , the experience of the immigrant day laborers is strongly influenced by their English-language proficiency-which helps them navigate daily life in the United States and communicate with employers-and their use of transportation to move around the city for work and daily life ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The results of this study offer new insight into the ways in which day laborers in Seattle use ICT to help them meet personal and employment needs and realize their long-term goals .
Research questions	"To reuse code that has been proven to work can increase any programmer 's productivity , benefit corporate productivity , and also increase the stability of software programs ."
Research findings/conclusions	This paper shows that fuzzy retrieval has an improved retrieval performance over typical Boolean retrieval .
Research questions	Various methods of fuzzy information retrieval implementation and their use for software reuse will be examined .
Research value/outlook/limitations	A deeper explanation of the fundamentals of designing a fuzzy information retrieval system for software reuse is presented .
Research method	Future research options and necessary data storage systems are explored .
Research method	Eighty-eight searchers performed four web search tasks prescribed by the researchers .
Research method	"Each task was linked to an existing target web page , containing a piece of text that served as the basis for the task ."
Research method	A matching phrasing was a task whose wording matched the text of the target page .
Research findings/conclusions	"A nonmatching phrasing was synonymous with the matching phrasing , but had no match with the target page ."
Research method	Searchers received tasks for both types in English and in Hebrew .
Research method	The search process was logged .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions confirm that task phrasing shapes the search process and outcome , and also user satisfaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Each search stageretrieval of the target page , visiting the target page , and finding the target answerwas associated with different phenomena ; for example , target page retrieval was negatively affected by persistence in search patterns ( e.g. , use of phrases ) , user-originated keywords , shorter queries , and omitting key keywords from the queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Searchers were easily driven away from the top-ranked target pages by lower-ranked pages with title tags matching the queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some searchers created consistently longer queries than other searchers , regardless of the task length ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Several consistent behavior patterns that characterized the Hebrew language were uncovered , including the use of keyword modifications ( replacing infinitive forms with nouns ) , omitting prefixes and articles , and preferences for the common language ."
Research findings/conclusions	The success self-assessment also depended on whether the wording of the answer matched the task phrasing .
Research questions	"In this work , we propose an anchor-based hybrid filtering approach ( AHF ) to naturally measure and capture the user 's preference stabilities for movie genres ."
Research method	"That is , a pairwise preference of the genre comparison process with the genre-based fuzzy inference filtering was conducted in order to achieve effective interactive recommendations ."
Research method	"To conduct this experiment , we recruited 30 users with different levels of preference stability for movie genres ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the proposed AHFapproach can effectively capture the user 's preferences and filter out undesired movie genres .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , this approach can give a more precise recommendation than one without the anchoring process , especially for the user who has unstable preferences for movie genres ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our proposed approach achieves statistical significance and outperforms the baseline method for recommending users ' favorite movies by more than 63 % for the stable user group and 77 % for the unstable group .
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that the stability of users ' preferences is a factor to be considered when developing effective recommendation strategies .
Research questions	"However , the goal of many discussion communities is to produce a high-quality knowledge resource , whether to improve external task performance or to increase reputation and site traffic ."
Research questions	What do moderation practices look like when the community is focused on the creation of a useable knowledge resource rather than facilitating an inclusive conversation ?
Research questions	Under what conditions is this style of moderation likely to be successful ?
Research method	"We present a case study from online gamingElitist Jerksin which aggressive moderation is used to transform a conversational medium into a high-quality knowledge resource , using the strategy of open censorship ."
Research method	We present a content analysis of moderator comments regarding censored messages .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis revealed differences in types of contributor mistakes and the severity of moderator actions : infractions that interfered with both conversation and resource quality were punished harshly , whereas a set of infractions that supported conversation but undermined resource quality were more respectfully removed ."
Research findings/conclusions	We describe a set of conditions under which moderators should intervene in the conversion of conversation to knowledge resource rather than the conversion of lurkers to contributors .
Research questions	"In this article , we describe ways to identify important concepts in documents using the relationships in a thesaurus or other vocabulary structures ."
Research method	We introduce a methodology for the analysis and modeling of the indexing process based on a weighted random walk algorithm .
Research questions	The primary goal of this research is the analysis of the contribution of thesaurus structure to the indexing process .
Research method	"The resulting models are evaluated in the context of automatic subject indexing using four collections of documents pre-indexed with 4 different thesauri ( AGROVOC [ UN Food and Agriculture Organization ] , high-energy physics taxonomy [ HEP ] , National Agricultural Library Thesaurus [ NALT ] , and medical subject headings [ MeSH ] ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We also introduce a thesaurus-centric matching algorithm intended to improve the quality of candidate concepts .
Research findings/conclusions	"In all cases , the weighted random walk improves automatic indexing performance over matching alone with an increase in average precision ( AP ) of 9 % for HEP , 11 % for MeSH , 35 % for NALT , and 37 % for AGROVOC ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of the analysis support our hypothesis that subject indexing is in part a browsing process , and that using the vocabulary and its structure in a thesaurus contributes to the indexing process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The amount that the vocabulary structure contributes was found to differ among the 4 thesauri , possibly due to the vocabulary used in the corresponding thesauri and the structural relationships between the terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	Each of the thesauri and the manual indexing associated with it
Research findings/conclusions	"To date , the project has proceeded in 2 key phases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we developed a bottom-up method for web register classification , asking end users of the web to utilize a decision-tree survey to code relevant situational characteristics of web documents , resulting in a bottom-up identification of register and subregister categories ."
Research method	We present details regarding the development and testing of this method through a series of 10 pilot studies .
Research method	"Then , in the second phase of our project we applied this procedure to a corpus of 53,000 web documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	An analysis of the results demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods for web register classification and provides a preliminary description of the types and distribution of registers on the web .
Research method	The first phase developed a typology of email classification patterns through a qualitative study involving 34 participants .
Research method	"Inspired by the fields of pragmatics and speech act theory , this typology comprising four top level categories and 13 subcategories represents the typical email triage behaviors of managers in an organizational context ."
Research method	"The second study phase was conducted on a corpus of 1,703 messages using email samples of two managers ."
Research method	"Using the k-NN ( k-nearest neighbor ) algorithm , statistical treatments automatically classified the email according to lexical and nonlexical features representative of managers ' triage patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The automatic classification of email according to the lexicon of the messages was found to be substantially more efficient when k ? = ? 2 and n ? = ? 2,000 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For four categories , the average recall rate was 94.32 % , the average precision rate was 94.50 % , and the accuracy rate was 94.54 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For 13 categories , the average recall rate was 91.09 % , the average precision rate was 84.18 % , and the accuracy rate was 88.70 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	It appears that a message 's nonlexical features are also deeply influenced by email pragmatics .
Research findings/conclusions	Features related to the recipient and the sender were the most relevant for characterizing email .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , problems with navigation and retrieval represent a barrier for this cohort ."
Research questions	"This article addresses one aspect of page design , testing whether a horizontal or vertical contents arrangement facilitates faster access to content for people with learning disabilities ."
Research method	Participants were timed as they looked for one-word dummy menu entries appearing in various locations along a horizontal or vertical grid .
Research method	The words corresponded to images shown at random in a word-search type activity .
Research method	Results were analyzed using mixed effects models .
Research findings/conclusions	Results showed that mean search times increased as the position shifted from left to right and from top to bottom .
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , participants undertook the test as if it were a reading exercise , despite the images appearing in the center of the page and the words appearing at random positions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The research also suggests that a horizontal menu may be more effective than a vertical one , with the most important links placed on the left ."
Research findings/conclusions	The propensity to imbibe information serially ( word-for-word ) rather than to skim or look globally has important website design implications .
Research questions	This article explores the extent to which YouTube videos are cited in academic publications and whether there are significant broad disciplinary differences in this practice .
Research method	"To investigate , we extracted the URL citations to YouTube videos from academic publications indexed by Scopus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A total of 1,808 Scopus publications cited at least one YouTube video , and there was a steady upward growth in citing online videos within scholarly publications from 2006 to 2011 , with YouTube citations being most common within arts and humanities ( 0.3 % ) and the social sciences ( 0.2 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A content analysis of 551 YouTube videos cited by research articles indicated that in science ( 78 % ) and in medicine and health sciences ( 77 % ) , over three fourths of the cited videos had either direct scientific ( e.g. , laboratory experiments ) or scientific-related contents ( e.g. , academic lectures or education ) whereas in the arts and humanities , about 80 % of the YouTube videos had art , culture , or history themes , and in the social sciences , about 63 % of the videos were related to news , politics , advertisements , and documentaries ."
Research findings/conclusions	This shows both the disciplinary differences and the wide variety of innovative research communication uses found for videos within the different subject areas .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some of the key problems that hamper their search experience is their limited vocabulary , their difficulty in using the right keywords , and the inappropriateness of their general-Research questions query suggestions ."
Research questions	"In this work , we propose a method that uses tags from social media to suggest queries related to children 's topics ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Concretely , we propose a simple yet effective approach to bias a random walk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources and tags through keywords that are more commonly used to describe resources for children ."
Research method	We evaluate our method using a large query log sample of queries submitted by children .
Research findings/conclusions	We show that our method outperforms by a large margin the query suggestions of modern search engines and state-of-the art query suggestions based on random walks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We improve further the quality of the ranking by combining the score of the random walk with topical and language modeling features to emphasize even more the child-related aspects of the query suggestions .
Research findings/conclusions	The results reveal that LIS researchers most frequently cite publications in their own discipline .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , half of all co-authors of LIS articles are affiliated with LIS-related institutes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results confirm that the degree of interdisciplinarity within LIS has increased , particularly co-authorship ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the study found sources of direct citations in LIS articles are widely distributed across 30 disciplines , but co-authors of LIS articles are distributed across only 25 disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	The degree of interdisciplinarity was found ranging from 0.61 to 0.82 with citation to references in all articles being the highest and that of co-authorship being the lowest .
Research findings/conclusions	"Percentages of contribution attributable to LIS show a decreasing tendency based on the results of direct citation and co-authorship analysis , but an increasing tendency based on those of bibliographic coupling analysis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Such differences indicate each of the three bibliometric methods has its strength and provides insights respectively for viewing various aspects of interdisciplinarity , suggesting the use of no single bibliometric method can reveal all aspects of interdisciplinarity due to its multifaceted nature ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Up to now , research has mainly focused on the evaluation of webpages , while the evaluation of SERPs received less attention ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , task complexity is often not taken into account ."
Research method	"A within-subjects design was used to study the influence of task complexity on search query formulation , evaluation of search results , and task performance ."
Research method	"Three search tasks were used : a fact-finding , cause-effect , and a controversial topic task ."
Research method	"To measure perceptual search processes , we used a combination of log files , eye-tracking data , answer forms , and think-aloud protocols ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results reveal that an increase in task complexity results in more search queries and used keywords , more time to formulate search queries , and more considered search results on the SERPs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , higher ranked search results were considered more often than lower ranked results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , not all the results for the most complex task were in line with expectations ."
Research findings/conclusions	These conflicting results can be explained by a lack of prior knowledge and the possible interference of prior attitudes .
Research findings/conclusions	"While the current modeling framework successfully captures citation dynamics of typical articles , there exists a nonnegligible , and perhaps most interesting , fraction of atypical articles whose citation trajectories do not follow the normal rise-and-fall pattern ."
Research questions	"Here we systematically study and classify citation patterns of atypical articles , finding that they can be characterized by awakened articles , second-acts , and a combination of both ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a second-act model that can accurately describe the citation dynamics of second-act articles .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The model not only provides a mechanistic framework to understand citation patterns of atypical articles , separating factors that drive impact , but it also offers new capabilities to identify the time of exogenous events that influence citations ."
Research questions	"The increasingly popular activity tracking technology ( ATT ) has given rise to a new type of personal information about one 's daily physical activities , which has not been scrutinized under theoretical frameworks in PIM ."
Research method	This article presents an in-depth qualitative interview study supplemented by participant-driven photo elicitation with 20 long-term activity tracker users about how they manage personal information generated by ATT .
Research findings/conclusions	"Key Research findings/conclusions include the identification of two distinctive user groups ( i.e. , consistent casual users and powers users ) among long-term activity tracker users and an in-depth portrayal of these groups ' PIM behaviors with ATT ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These behaviors include concurrent and subsequent PIM practices , 6 types of PIM activities , and the use of a spectrum of PIM tools ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research provides timely theoretical updates to PIM under the background of self-tracking technologies , outlines empirical implications to improve ATT in support of PIM , and offers recommendations for incorporating participant-driven photo elicitation as a supplementary method for qualitative interviews in information behavior research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Evaluations of an enterprise search have predominately focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of the engine , with very little analysis of user involvement in the process , and none on the role of service providers ."
Research questions	We propose and evaluate a model of costs and benefits to a service provider when investing in enhancements to the ranking of documents returned by their search engine .
Research method	We demonstrate the model through a case study to analyze the potential impact of using domain experts to provide enhanced mediated search results .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By demonstrating how to quantify the cost and benefit of an improved information retrieval system to the service provider , our case study shows that using the relevance assessments of domain experts to rerank original search results can significantly improve the accuracy of ranked lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the service provider gains substantial return on investment and a higher search success rate by investing in the relevance assessments of domain experts ."
Research method	"Our cost and benefit analysis results are contrasted with standard modes of effectiveness analysis , including quantitative ( using measures such as precision ) and qualitative ( through user preference surveys ) approaches ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Modeling costs and benefits explicitly can provide useful insights that the other approaches do not convey .
Research questions	A key challenge in opinion retrieval is to capture the query-related opinion score of a document .
Research questions	Existing methods rely mainly on the proximity information between the opinion terms and the query terms to address the key challenge .
Research questions	"In this study , we propose to incorporate the syntactic and semantic information of terms into a probabilistic model to capture the query-related opinion score more accurately ."
Research method	The syntactic tree structure of a sentence is used to evaluate the modifying probability between an opinion term and a noun within the sentence with a tree kernel method .
Research method	"Moreover , WordNet and the probabilistic topic model are used to evaluate the semantic relatedness between any noun and the given query ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results over standard TREC baselines on the benchmark BLOG06 collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method , in comparison with the proximity-based method and other baselines ."
Research questions	"Entity linking has been well explored for dissemination-oriented sources such as news stories , blogs , and microblog posts , but the limited work to date on conversational sources such as email or text chat has not yet attempted to determine when the referent entity is not in the knowledge base ( a task known as NIL detection ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article presents a supervised machine learning system for linking named mentions of people in email messages to a collection-specific knowledge base , and that is also capable of NIL detection ."
Research method	This system learns from manually annotated training examples to leverage a rich set of features .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The entity linking accuracy for entities present in the knowledge base is substantially and significantly better than the best previously reported results on the Enron email collection , comparable accuracy is reported for the challenging NIL detection task , and these results are for the first time replicated on a second email collection from a different source with comparable results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the study , we identified 21 RIM services offered to researchers , ranging from discovering , storing , and sharing authored content to identifying expertise , recruiting faculty , and ensuring the diversity of committee assignments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , we identified 15 types of RIM service provision and adoption problems , analyzed their activity structures , and connected them to strategies for their resolution ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we report on skills that the study participants reported as being needed in their work ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions can inform the development of best practice guides for RIM on university campuses .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study also advances the state of the art of RIM research by applying the typology of contradictions from activity theory to categorize the problems of RIM service provision and connect their resolution to theories and Research findings/conclusions of prior studies in the literature .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this way , the research expands the theoretical base used to study RIM in general and RIM at research universities in particular ."
Research method	"An approach , BayesAD , is developed for solving this problem : apply a Bayesian segmentation algorithm , followed by a segment clustering algorithm ."
Research method	"Results are presented from an empirical comparison between BayesAD and AK , a modified version of an approach published by Akiva and Koppel in 2013 ."
Research findings/conclusions	BayesAD exhibited greater accuracy than AK in all experiments .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , BayesAD has a parameter that needs to be set and which had a nontrivial impact on accuracy ."
Research findings/conclusions	Developing an effective method for eliminating this need would be a fruitful direction for future work .
Research findings/conclusions	"When controlling for topic , the accuracy levels of BayesAD and AK were , in all but one case , worse than a baseline approach wherein one author was assumed to write all sentences in the input text document ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , room for improved solutions exists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There is a close relationship between the technologies that a field utilizes and sanctions and the process of inquiry , the character and meaning of corroborative data and evidence , and the kinds of models and theories developed in a field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As the machinery changes , epistemic practices also change ."
Research questions	A case in point is how the epistemic practices of historians are reconfigured by the introduction of Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"We argue that GIS mediates historical understanding and knowledge creation in at least three ways : ( a ) by allowing historians to bring new sets of data into analysis , ( b ) by introducing novel questions , fresh insights , and new modes of analysis and reasoning , or discovering new answers to older questions ; and ( c ) by providing new tools for historians to communicate with each other and with their audiences ."
Research questions	We illustrate these mediations through the study of the historiography of Budapest Ghettos during World War II .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our study shows how GIS functionalities reveal hitherto unknown aspects of social life in the ghettos , while pushing certain other aspects into the background ."
Research method	"This study explores the scattering patterns of patent impact based on citations in 3 distinct technological areas , the liquid crystal , semiconductor , and drug technological areas , to identify the core patents in each area ."
Research method	"The research follows the approach from Bradford 's law , which equally divides total citations into 3 zones ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While the result suggests that the scattering of patent citations corresponded with features of Bradford 's law , the proportion of patents in the 3 zones did not match the proportion as proposed by the law ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , the study shows that the distributions of citations in all 3 areas were more concentrated than what Bradford 's law proposed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Groos ( 1967 ) droop was also presented by the scattering of patent citations , and the growth rate of cumulative citation decreased in the third zone ."
Research questions	"Our work was undertaken in the context of a new design concept , Privacy Trends , whose aspiration is to foster technology users ' digital literacy regarding ongoing privacy risks and elucidate how such risks fit within existing social , organizational , and political systems , leading to a longer-term privacy concern ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our study reveals 2 challenges for privacy intervention design : the need to develop technology users ' intrinsic motivations with the privacy domain and the importance of framing the concept of privacy within users ' interests .
Research findings/conclusions	Setting our study within a design context enables us to identify 4 design opportunities for fostering engagement with the privacy domain through technology design .
Research questions	"Running specialized software , personal devices such as phones and tablets can capture and transmit users location , images , motion , and text input ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The data collected by these devices are both personal ( identifying of an individual ) and participatory ( accessible by that individual for aggregation , analysis , and sharing ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Such participatory personal data provide a new area of inquiry for the information sciences .
Research method	"This article presents a review of literature from diverse fields , including information science , technology studies , surveillance studies , and participatory research traditions to explore how participatory personal data relate to existing personal data collections created by both research and surveillance ."
Research method	"It applies three information perspectivesinformation policy , information access and equity , and data curation and preservationto illustrate social impacts and concerns engendered by this new form of data collection ."
Research findings/conclusions	These perspectives suggest a set of research challenges for information science posed by participatory personal data .
Research findings/conclusions	The stability of citation rankings over time can be regarded as confirming the validity of evaluative citation analysis .
Research method	"This stability over time was investigated for two sets of citation records from the Web of Science ( Thomson Reuters , Philadelphia , PA ) for articles published in journals classified in Journal Citation Reports as Mathematics ."
Research method	These sets are of all such articles for the 1960s and for the 1970s .
Research findings/conclusions	This study employs only descriptive statistics and draws no inferences to any larger population .
Research findings/conclusions	The study found a high correlation from one decade to the next of rankings among sets of most highly cited articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the study found a low correlation for rankings among articles whose ranks were the 500 directly below those of the 500 most cited ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This perhaps expected result is discussed in terms of the Glanzel-Schubert-Schoepflin stochastic model for citation processes and also in connection with an account of the Research questionss of evaluative citation analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	This interpretative context suggests why the limitations of citation analysis may be inherent to citation analysis even when it is done well .
Research questions	"Consumer groups and experts have raised concerns about privacy , as smart meters can provide detailed information about activity within the home ."
Research method	This study examines privacy beliefs of U.S. consumers using qualitative data from focus groups together with experimental data from a national online survey of utility customers .
Research findings/conclusions	Exploratory analysis of focus group Research findings/conclusions suggested that consumers who felt in control of their data perceived fewer risks and more benefits from having access to the data .
Research findings/conclusions	Participants in the online experiment saw greater risk and less benefit when advised that smart meters could be used to raise prices under time-of-use pricing .
Research findings/conclusions	Participants also saw greater risk when the utility shared customer data with a third party .
Research findings/conclusions	Risks and benefits influenced perceptions of control .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These Research findings/conclusions accord with several information privacy frameworks adding new insights about consumers ' perceived control over their energy data .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions can inform utility companies and policymakers with respect to giving consumers more control over their data , reducing consumers ' privacy concerns , communicating benefits of smart meter data , and providing accurate information about the risks ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article presents a systematic study regarding the censorship ofbothplain text and multimedia content on the Chinese Internet .
Research findings/conclusions	"By analyzing both censored and surviving posts on the Chinese social media platform Weibo during the 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement , we find that multimedia posts suffered more intensive censorship deletion than plain text posts , with censorship programs being oriented more toward multimedia content like images than the text content of multimedia posts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis has significant implications for censorship studies , information control , and politics in the post-text era ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main contribution of our approach is to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty of the indexing task using possibility theory .
Research method	We enhance estimation of the similarity between a document and a given concept using the two measures of possibility and necessity .
Research findings/conclusions	Possibility estimates the extent to which a document is not similar to the concept .
Research findings/conclusions	The second measure can provide confirmation that the document is similar to the concept .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our contribution also reduces the limitation of partial matching .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the latter allows extracting from the document other variants of terms than those in dictionaries , it also generates irrelevant information ."
Research questions	Our objective is to filter the index using the knowledge provided by the Unified Medical Language System ( R ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments were carried out on different corpora , showing encouraging results ( the improvement rate is +26.37 % in terms of main average precision when compared with the baseline ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	This overlay map technique may support competitive intelligence and policy decision making .
Research method	The global patent map is based on similarities in citing-to-cited relationships between categories of the International Patent Classification ( IPC ) of European Patent Office ( EPO ) patents from 2000 to 2006 .
Research method	"This patent data set , extracted from the PATSTAT database , includes 760,000 patent records in 466 IPC-based categories ."
Research method	We compare the global patent maps derived from this categorization to related efforts of other global patent maps .
Research findings/conclusions	The paper overlays the nanotechnology-related patenting activities of two companies and two different nanotechnology subfields on the global patent map .
Research findings/conclusions	The exercise shows the potential of patent overlay maps to visualize technological areas and potentially support decision making .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , this study shows that IPC categories that are similar to one another based on citing-to-cited patterns ( and thus close in the global patent map ) are not necessarily in the same hierarchical IPC branch , thereby revealing new relationships between technologies that are classified as pertaining to different ( and sometimes distant ) subject areas in the IPC scheme ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On closer examination , however , the term holistic is used mainly as a rhetorical device in the literature , rather than as one that embraces the epistemological tenets of a holistic paradigm , and applies these to research design ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper examines this rhetorical use , and explores what it would mean , and why it would matter , to adopt substantively holistic approaches to research ."
Research method	We review relevant literature in library and information science to position past uses of holistic and compare these to the conceptual intentions of holism .
Research questions	"We also outline the concept of holism , itself , with a focus on methodological and ontological holism , which can most deeply inform research design in our discipline ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Greater methodological diversity , including much wider adoption of interpretivist and critical approaches , can address the concerns underlying the use of holistic rhetoric ."
Research findings/conclusions	We illustrate this central conceptual argument with a roadmap illustrating holistic considerations throughout the research process .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The paper demonstrates that it is possible to shift away from predominantly rhetorical use of holistic , toward paradigmatically holistic research , which will provide for richer analyses of critical phenomena in the discipline ."
Research method	The core component of the model uses inferences along the paths of typed relations between the entities of a knowledge representation for enabling the determination of result sets in the context of retrieval processes .
Research findings/conclusions	"A proposal for a general , but condensed , inventory of typed relations is given ."
Research method	The entities are arranged in aspect-oriented facets to ensure a consistent hierarchical structure .
Research findings/conclusions	The possible consequences for indexing and retrieval are discussed .
Research questions	"Small humanitarian organizations that help irregular migrants in the United States frequently do not have the resources or expertise to fully address the implications of collecting , storing , and using data about the vulnerable populations they serve ."
Research questions	"As a result , there is a risk that their work could exacerbate the vulnerabilities of the very same migrants they are trying to help ."
Research questions	"In this study , we propose a conceptual framework for protecting privacy in the context of humanitarian information activities ( HIA ) with irregular migrants ."
Research method	"We draw from a review of the academic literature as well as interviews with individuals affiliated with several US-based humanitarian organizations , higher education institutions , and nonprofit organizations that provide support to undocumented migrants ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss 3 primary issues : ( i ) HIA present both technological and human risks ; ( ii ) the expectation of privacy self-management by vulnerable populations is problematic ; and ( iii ) there is a need for robust , actionable , privacy-related guidelines for HIA ."
Research findings/conclusions	We suggest 5 recommendations to strengthen the privacy protection offered to undocumented migrants and other vulnerable populations .
Research questions	"The review focuses on the expanded notion of videogames ( the EN ) , a concept this paper introduces to collectively refer to the cultural and social aspects of videogamesfor example , game culture , experiences , play , and community life and activity ."
Research method	The study 's research aims are pursued on the basis of a critical systematic literature review of 42 publications originating from academic research and videogame-archiving projects .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study 's main finding is that the archiving literature construes the EN of videogames in three principal ways : i ) as an essential part of the videogame as an archival object ; ii ) as a useful resource in archiving videogames , able to provide documentation of game culture and social context ; and iii ) as a useful resource in inquiries focused on the current state and recent history of society and culture from a sociotechnical viewpoint ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study suggests videogame community dynamics , videogame ontology , the development of archival theory , and videogame-archive studies as rewarding directions for further research ."
Research method	"In this article , we introduce SemGraph , an unsupervised algorithm for extracting keyphrases from a collection of texts based on a semantic relationship graph ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main novelty of this algorithm is its ability to identify semantic relationships between words whose presence is statistically significant .
Research method	"Our method constructs a co-occurrence graph in which words appearing in the same document are linked , provided their presence in the collection is statistically significant with respect to a null model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , the graph obtained is enriched with information from WordNet ."
Research method	We have used the most recent and standardized benchmark to evaluate the system ability to detect the keyphrases that are part of the text .
Research findings/conclusions	The result is a method that achieves an improvement of 5.3 % and 7.28 % in F measure over the two labeled sets of keyphrases used in the evaluation of SemEval-2010 .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , both clinical information retrieval research innovation and legitimate privacy concerns can be served by the creation of intrainstitutional , fully protected resources ."
Research questions	"In this article , we provide some principles and tools for information retrieval resource-building in the unique problem setting of patient-level information retrieval , following the tradition of the Cranfield paradigm ."
Research method	We further include an analysis of parallel information retrieval resources at Oregon Health & Science University and Mayo Clinic that were built on these principles .
Research questions	"The concepts of meaning-making , transitioning , and information seeking in deeply meaningful and profoundly personal contexts are used in order to understand transgender individuals ' information seeking in the contexts of gender identity formation ."
Research method	"Based on the literature , emotions and information seeking connected to a significant life change were divided into four phases to study how they could be identified in the 25 qualitative interviews with transgender individuals from Finland between the ages of 15 and 72 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the Research findings/conclusions of this study , in significant life changes , an individual needs reliable , sensible and identifiable information ."
Research findings/conclusions	Serendipitous encounters and embodied experiences characterize information seeking during transitional stages .
Research findings/conclusions	Peer communities are important for minorities in order to find places where interviewees feel safe to share information and experiences .
Research findings/conclusions	These communities can also be found online .
Research findings/conclusions	The concept of deeply meaningful information highlights the effect information has on information seekers .
Research questions	"Deeply meaningful information can serve as a trigger for life change , helping people forward during the transitions ."
Research method	This article explores this assertion via systematic analysis of studies published in journals between 1950 and 2012 .
Research method	"Five time periods and four journals were sampled , including 1,391 journal articles , 915 of which were empirical studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these samples , the percentage of studies of information outcomes climbed from zero in the 1950s and 1960s , to 8 % in recent research reports ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The barriers to studying information outcomes and possible future research on this topic are explored .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , much less is known about such internationalization in the social sciences ."
Research method	"In this study , we analyze international and domestic coauthorship relations of all citable items in the DVD version of the Social Sciences Citation Index 2011 ( SSCI ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Network statistics indicate 4 groups of nations : ( a ) an Asian-Pacific one to which all Anglo-Saxon nations ( including the United Kingdom and Ireland ) are attributed , ( b ) a continental European one including also the Latin-American countries , ( c ) the Scandinavian nations , and ( d ) a community of African nations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Within the EU-28 , 11 of the EU-15 states have dominant positions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In many respects , the network parameters are not so different from the Science Citation Index ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition to these descriptive statistics , we address the question of the relative weights of the international versus domestic networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An information-theoretical test is proposed at the level of organizational addresses within each nation ; the results are mixed , but the international dimension is more important than the national one in the aggregated sets ( as in the Science Citation Index ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In some countries ( e.g. , France ) , however , the national distribution is leading more than the international one ."
Research findings/conclusions	Decomposition of the United States in terms of states shows a similarly mixed result ; more U.S. states are domestically oriented in the SSCI and more internationally in the SCI .
Research findings/conclusions	The international networks have grown during the last decades in addition to the national ones but not by replacing them .
Research method	"We have surveyed 200 computer science publications , 100 journal articles , and 100 conference papers , using self-citations to identify potential and actual continuations ."
Research questions	"We are interested in determining the proportion of papers that do indeed continue , how and when the continuation takes place , and whether any distinctions are found between the journal and conference populations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the implicit assumption of a research line behind each paper , manifest in the ubiquitous future research notes that close many of them , we find that more than 70 % of the papers are never continued ."
Research questions	"However , treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform ."
Research findings/conclusions	We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper .
Research questions	"For this Research questions , we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation ."
Research method	"By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work , we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence ."
Research method	"Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning , we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The best features , among those we evaluated , were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper ."
Research method	The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index ( the hip-index ) .
Research method	"Unlike the conventional h-index , it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to our experiments , the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index ."
Research method	We use the same Thomson Reuters data set of about 4.4 million articles used in Crespo et al .
Research method	( 2013a ) to analyze 22 broad fields .
Research findings/conclusions	"The main results are the following : First , when the classification system goes from 22 fields to 219 subfields the effect on citation inequality of differences in citation practices increases from similar to 14 % at the field level to 18 % at the subfield level ."
Research method	"Second , we estimate a set of exchange rates ( ERs ) over a wide [ 660 , 978 ] citation quantile interval to express the citation counts of articles into the equivalent counts in the all-sciences case ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the fractional case , for example , we find that in 187 of 219 subfields the ERs are reliable in the sense that the coefficient of variation is smaller than or equal to 0.10 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Third , in the fractional case the normalization of the raw data using the ERs ( or subfield mean citations ) as normalization factors reduces the importance of the differences in citation practices from 18 % to 3.8 % ( 3.4 % ) of overall citation inequality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Fourth , the results in the fractional case are essentially replicated when we adopt a multiplicative approach ."
Research method	"It was written by Walker Lundy of the Charlotte Observer in Charlotte , NC , USA on August 6 , 2016 ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The article was shocking , even to a non-U.S. citizen , because it revealed the sudden , and unexpected , withdrawal of Donald J. Trump from the U.S. Presidential race , which would surely have been welcome news for the Hillary Clinton camp ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Less than 24 hours later , that article could no longer be traced on Yahoo , and the original links led to a 404 error ."
Research findings/conclusions	The original story is still published on another Charlotte Observer webpage .
Research findings/conclusions	"National and independent polls related to the presidential election fluctuate , but pollsters are always influenced by news events related to either candidate ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , one has to wonder why Mr. Lundy would have published a false and misleading story , which was widely circulated , including by the powerful media engine Yahoo , that has serious national and international consequences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Some of the policies espoused by both presidential candidates are radically different , and thus any media story that can tilt the opinion of readers in the direction of one or other candidate needs to be carefully analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	Sowing doubt by using false or misleading journalism does not do the public any favors and casts a doubtful light on the practice of political journalism .
Research method	The Charlotte Observer and Mr. Lundy failed to respond to a request for comment .
Research findings/conclusions	"The result of the analysis is a conceptual framework of Information Quality ( IQ ) measures designed for validating contradictory sources of attribution on the basis of a documentary , evidence-based approach ."
Research questions	The aim is to develop an ontology-based ranking model for recommending artwork attributions and support historians and catalogers ' decision-making process .
Research method	The conceptual framework was evaluated by means of a user study and the evaluation of a web application leveraging the aforementioned ranking model .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the survey demonstrate that the Research findings/conclusions satisfy users ' expectations and are potentially applicable to other types of information in the arts and humanities field .
Research questions	"Although context-aware recommender systems ( CARS ) have been widely analyzed , personalized pricing or discount optimization in recommender systems to improve recommendations ' accuracy and commercial KPIs has hardly been researched ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article studies how to model user-item personalized discount sensitivity and incorporate it into a real time contextual recommender system in such a way that it can be integrated into a commercial service .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We propose a novel approach for modeling context-aware user-item personalized discount sensitivity in a sparse data scenario and present a new CARS algorithm that combines coclustering and random forest classification ( CBRF ) to incorporate the personalized discount sensitivity .
Research method	We conducted an experimental study with real consumers and mobile discount coupons to evaluate our solution .
Research method	We compared the CBRF algorithm to the widely used context-aware matrix factorization ( CAMF ) algorithm .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results suggest that incorporating personalized discount sensitivity significantly improves the consumption prediction accuracy and that the suggested CBRF algorithm provides better prediction results for this use case .
Research method	"To better understand the nature of these tags , we analyzed tags assigned to a collection of 100 images of art ( provided by the steve ."
Research method	museum project ) using subject matter categorization .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that the majority of tags describe the people and objects in the image and are generic in nature .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This contradicts prior subject matter analyses of queries , tags , and index terms of other image collections , suggesting that the nature of social tags largely depends on the type of collection and on user needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	This insight may help cultural heritage institutions improve their management and use of tags .
Research questions	It is not uncommon to reuse versatile decorative shape patterns across batiks .
Research questions	"General-Research questions image retrieval methods often fail to pay sufficient attention to such a frequent reuse of shape patterns in the graphical compositions of batiks , leading to suboptimal retrieval results , in particular for identifying batiks that use copyrighted shape patterns without proper authorization for law-enforcement Research questionss ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To address the lack of an optimized image retrieval method suited for batiks , this study proposes a new method for retrieving salient shape patterns in batiks using a rich combination of global and local features ."
Research method	The global features deployed were extracted according to the Zernike moments ( ZMs ) ; the local features adopted were extracted through curvelet transformations that characterize shape contours embedded in batiks .
Research method	The method subsequently incorporated both types of features via matching a weighted bipartite graph to measure the visual similarity between any pair of batik shape patterns through supervised distance metric learning .
Research findings/conclusions	"The derived similarity metric can then be used to detect and retrieve similar shape patterns appearing across batiks , which in turn can be employed as a reliable similarity metric for retrieving batiks ."
Research method	"To explore the usefulness of the proposed method , the performance of the new retrieval method is compared against that of three peer methods as well as two variants of the proposed method ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results consistently and convincingly demonstrate that the new method indeed outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in retrieving salient shape patterns in batiks .
Research questions	"In theoretical models of trust in information , the concept of trustworthiness is emerging as both fundamentally important and understudied , particularly in the domain of digital repositories ."
Research method	This article reports on a qualitative study designed to elicit from groups of end users components of trustworthiness and to assess their relative importance .
Research method	The study draws on interview data from 3 focus groups with experienced users of the Washington State Digital Archives .
Research method	"Utilizing thematic analysis and micro-interlocutor analysis to examine a combination of interview transcripts and video recordings , the study provides a realistic picture of the strength and character of emergent themes that underpin the more general concept of trustworthiness ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The study reinforces the centrality of trustworthiness at the individual document level , but calls into question the formulation of trustworthiness as a concept in Kelton , Fleischmann , and Wallace 's ( 2008 ) Integrated Model of Trust in Information ."
Research method	"It studies articles published in a single journal : the Journal of Informetrics ( JOI ) , in the first year the journal was published , 2007 ."
Research method	"The analysis classified the citations into in-and out-disciplinary content and looked at their use within the articles ' sections such as introduction , literature review , methodology , Research findings/conclusions , discussion , and conclusions ."
Research method	"In addition , it took into account the age of cited articles ."
Research method	A thematic analysis of these citations was performed in order to identify the evolution of topics within the articles sections and the journal 's content .
Research findings/conclusions	"A matrix describing the relationships between the citations ' use , and their in- and out-disciplinary focus within the articles ' sections is presented ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions show that an analysis of citations based on their in-and out-disciplinary orientation within the context of the articles ' sections can be an indication of the manner by which cross-disciplinary science works , and reveals the connections between the issues , methods , analysis , and conclusions coming from different research disciplines ."
Research method	We conducted a study that investigated this issue by comparing Google Trends and Baidu Index .
Research method	"Data from these two services are based on queries entered by users into Google and Baidu , two of the largest search engines in the world ."
Research method	We first compared the features and functions of the two services based on documents and extensive testing .
Research method	We then carried out an empirical study that collected query volume data from the two sources .
Research findings/conclusions	We found that data from both sources could be used to predict the quality of Chinese universities and companies .
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the differences between the two services in terms of technology , such as differing methods of language processing , the search volume data from the two were highly correlated and combining the two data sources did not improve the predictive power of the data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , there was a major difference between the two in terms of data availability ."
Research findings/conclusions	Baidu Index was able to provide more search volume data than Google Trends did .
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis showed that the disadvantage of Google Trends in this regard was due to Google 's smaller user base in China .
Research findings/conclusions	The implication of this finding goes beyond China .
Research findings/conclusions	"Google 's user bases in many countries are smaller than that in China , so the search volume data related to those countries could result in the same issue as that related to China ."
Research method	"By using information retrieval and meta-search approaches , different types of referential metadata , such as related Wikipedia pages , data sets , source code , video lectures , presentation slides , and ( online ) tutorials for scientific publications and scientific topics will be automatically retrieved , associated , and ranked ."
Research method	"In order to test our method of automatic cyberlearning referential metadata generation , we designed a user experiment to validate the quality of the metadata for each scientific keyword and publication and resource-ranking algorithm ."
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results show that the cyberlearning referential metadata retrieved via meta-search and statistical relevance ranking can help students better understand the essence of scientific keywords and publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"Theoretically these two types of articles are independent , in the sense that suffering delayed recognition depends on the number and time distribution of received citations , while being an under-cited influential article depends only partially on the number of received ( first generation ) citations , and much more on second and third citation generations ."
Research findings/conclusions	Among 49 articles suffering delayed recognition we found 13 that are also under-cited influential .
Research method	Based on a thorough investigation of these special cases we found that so-called authoritative citers play an important role in uniting the two different document types into a special citation chimera .
Research method	Our investigation contributes to the classification of publications .
Research questions	The success of a website therefore depends on its ability to improve consumers ' perceptions of privacy assurance .
Research questions	"Seals and assurance statements are mechanisms often used to increase this assurance ; however , the Research findings/conclusions of the extant literature regarding the effectiveness of these tools are mixed ."
Research questions	"We propose a model based on the elaboration likelihood model ( ELM ) that explains conditions under which privacy assurance is more or less effective , clarifying the contradictory Research findings/conclusions in previous literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We test our model in a free-simulation online experiment , and the results of the analysis indicate that the inclusion of assurance statements and the combination , understanding , and assurance of seals influence privacy assurance ."
Research findings/conclusions	Privacy assurance is most effective when seals and statements are accompanied by the peripheral cues of website quality and brand image and when counter-argumentation-through transaction risk-is minimized .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Importantly , we show ELM to be an appropriate theoretical lens to explain the equivocal results in the literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we suggest theoretical and practical implications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts , and each has a different history , methodological grounding , and often a different thematic focus ."
Research questions	"The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI-intellectual ( regional schools of thought ) , methodological , and thematic-and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches ."
Research method	"Thus , the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought , along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI ."
Research method	The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus , due to the rapid development of information and communication technology , social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization , the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility , without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries , as is typical in modern science ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide .
Research findings/conclusions	"We looked at one aspect of the interactions between reviewers and authors , the use of politeness in reviewers ' comments ."
Research method	"Drawing on Brown and Levinson 's ( 1987 ) politeness theory , we analyzed how politeness strategies were employed by reviewers to mitigate their criticisms in an open peer-review process of a special track of a human-computer interaction conference ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found evidence of frequent use of politeness strategies and that open peer-review processes hold unique challenges and opportunities for using politeness strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions revealed that less experienced researchers tended to express unmitigated criticism more often than did experienced researchers , and that reviewers tended to use more positive politeness strategies ( e.g. , compliments ) toward less experienced authors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on our Research findings/conclusions , we discuss implications for research communities and the design of peer-reviewing processes and the information systems that support them ."
Research questions	Our idea consists of two main aspects : engaging wider society with usability and distributing the topic across disciplines .
Research questions	We claim that bad usability is a social justice issue .
Research questions	"Primarily , we propose that usability should become the subject of widespread activism across society , enabling more people to realize that their usability problems are not due to inadequacies in themselves but in current designs ."
Research findings/conclusions	People should be encouraged and enabled to complain about their experiences with an expectation of improvements .
Research questions	We also propose that the current restriction of this topic to certain disciplinary units is overly narrow and that instead there should be radical embedding of usability concepts across many different fields and settings .
Research findings/conclusions	We believe that the usability of information systems is core to information science and that information scientists should resume their historic role as heralds and pioneers of human-computer interaction .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and unrealistic , and while there has been some push-back on these concerns , the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called out ."
Research questions	Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and confusion about what AI is and can ever be .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this work we identify 3 factors that contribute to this AI anxiety : an exclusive focus on AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture , confusion about autonomy in computational entities and in humans , and an inaccurate conception of technological development ."
Research questions	With this analysis we argue that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons typically given by AI alarmists .
Research method	"Using a questionnaire on metrics use and publication practices in Australia and Sweden , we tested the assumption that indicators play a minor role among humanities scholars ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions show that our respondents use indicators to a considerable degree , with a range of indicators and rankings being employed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The scholars use metrics as part of institutional policy , in CVs and applications , as well as for general promotion of their work ."
Research findings/conclusions	Notable in our results is that a much larger share of researchers ( 62 % ) in Australia used metrics compared to Sweden ( 14 % ) .
Research questions	"Scholar 's attitudes regarding bibliometrics are mixed ; many are critical of these measures , while at the same time feeling pressured to use them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"One main tension described by our respondents is between intradisciplinary criteria of quality and formalized indicators , and negotiating these orders of worth is a challenging balancing act , especially for younger researchers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to the normative point of view , the behavior of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"According to the constructivist perspective , citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that are useful for the Research questionss of interpretation ."
Research findings/conclusions	An intermediate position supports normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts .
Research method	"In this paper , this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three political or ideological camps , and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially strong constructivist reason to cite ."
Research method	An all-author co-citation analysis was performed to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence of three camps .
Research findings/conclusions	We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the co-citation map .
Research findings/conclusions	"The map , in fact , included authors who obtained high citation counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according to topic and not by camp .
Research findings/conclusions	Relevant scientific works were cited by the members of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp .
Research method	Participants were asked to draw the face of a 3D visualization after it was cut in half .
Research method	"We videotaped the participants as they drew , erased , verbalized their thoughts , gestured , and moved about a two-dimensional paper presentation of the 3D visualization ."
Research method	The videorecords were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to generate hypotheses related to comprehension difficulties and visualization properties .
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis of the results uncovered three properties that made problem solving more difficult for participants .
Research findings/conclusions	"These were : ( a ) cuts that were at an angle in relation to at least one plane of reference , ( b ) nonplanar properties of the features contained in the 3D visualizations including curved layers and v-shaped layers , and ( c ) mixed combinations of layers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , ( a ) cutting planes that were perpendicular or parallel to the 3D visualization diagram 's planes of reference , ( b ) internal features that were flat/planar , and ( c ) homogeneous layers were easier to comprehend ."
Research findings/conclusions	This research has direct implications for the generation and use of 3D information visualizations in that it suggests design features to include and avoid .
Research findings/conclusions	"Here , Tolstoy means that for a family to be happy , several key aspects must be given ( e.g. , good health of all family members , acceptable financial security , and mutual affection ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If there is a deficiency in any one or more of these key aspects , the family will be unhappy ."
Research questions	"In this article , we introduce the Anna Karenina principle as a way of thinking about success in science in three central areas in ( modern ) science : ( a ) peer review of research grant proposals and manuscripts ( money and journal space as scarce resources ) , ( b ) citation of publications ( reception as a scarce resource ) , and ( c ) new scientific discoveries ( recognition as a scarce resource ) ."
Research questions	"If resources are scarce at the highly competitive research front ( journal space , funds , reception , and recognition ) , there can be success only when several key prerequisites for the allocation of the resources are fulfilled ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled , the grant proposal , manuscript submission , the published paper , or the discovery will not be successful ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study investigates the RCR by correlating it on the level of single publications with established field-normalized indicators and assessments of the publications by peers .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the RCR correlates highly with established field-normalized indicators , but the correlation between RCR and peer assessments is only low to medium ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From this theory , it follows that journal editors might employ biased reviewers because they shirk less ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This creates an incentive for the editor to use monitoring mechanisms ( e.g. , associate editors supervising the peer review process ) that mitigate the resulting bias in the reviewers ' recommendations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The supervision of associate editors could encourage journal editors to employ more extreme reviewers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This theory helps to explain the presence of bias in peer review .
Research findings/conclusions	"To mitigate shirking by a reviewer , the journal editor may assign biased referees to generate information about the manuscript 's quality and subject the reviewer 's recommendations to supervision by a more aligned associate editor ."
Research findings/conclusions	Definitions of such measures have ranged from using distance-based calculations over WordNet or other taxonomies to statistical distributional metrics over document collections such as Wikipedia or the Web .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Existing measures do not explicitly consider the domain associations of terms when calculating relatedness : This article demonstrates that domain matters .
Research method	We construct a data set of pairs of terms with associated domain information and extract pairs that are scored nearly identical by a sample of existing semantic-relatedness measures .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that human judgments reliably score those pairs containing terms from the same domain as significantly more related than cross-domain pairs , even though the semantic-relatedness measures assign the pairs similar scores ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We provide further evidence for this result using a machine learning setting by demonstrating that domain is an informative feature when learning a metric .
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that existing relatedness measures do not account for domain in the same way or to the same extent as do human judges .
Research findings/conclusions	"An important component of these are policies that deal with anonymity : The rules that govern the concealment and transparency of information related to identities of the various stakeholders ( authors , reviewers , editors , and others ) involved in the peer-review process ."
Research questions	Anonymity policies have been a subject of debate for several decades within scholarly communities .
Research questions	"Because of widespread criticism of traditional peer-review processes , a variety of new peer-review processes have emerged that manage the trade-offs between disclosure and concealment of identities in different ways ."
Research method	"Based on an analysis of policies and guidelines for authors and reviewers provided by publication venues , we developed a framework for understanding how disclosure and concealment of identities is managed ."
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss the appropriate role of information technology and computer support for the peer-review process within that framework .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Inappropriate use of anomalous literature is evinced by citation of invalidated scholarly works , and though it is known that republished versions of articles are cited more often than corrected versions , the strength of the effect of invalidation , correction , and republication has not been previously quantified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Robust analysis of 15,000+ citations to 548 articles indexed in PubMed indicates that the practice of correction and republication is a strong predictor of reduced post-republication citation relative to controls ."
Research findings/conclusions	This bibliometric analysis shows that corrected articles are cited on average 51 % less than controls overall and that the practice of correction and republication results in a fast-acting and long-lasting reduction in citation of flawed works by downstream researchers .
Research method	"In this study , we investigated how the language used in TED talks influenced popularity and viewer ratings ."
Research method	We also investigated the differences in linguistic style and ratings of talks given by academics and non-academics .
Research method	The transcripts of 1866 talks were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program and eight language variables were correlated with number of views and viewer ratings .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that talks with more analytic language received fewer views , while a greater use of the pronoun I , positive emotion and social words was associated with more views ."
Research findings/conclusions	Talks with these linguistic characteristics received more emotional viewer ratings such as inspiring or courageous .
Research findings/conclusions	"When comparing talks by academics and non-academics , there was no difference in the overall popularity but viewers rated talks by academics as more fascinating , informative , and persuasive while non-academics received higher emotional ratings ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The implications for understanding social influence processes are discussed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article follows up on previous research from 2009 on this subject .
Research method	We reexamined tweets from the US Congress collected in early 2017 .
Research findings/conclusions	We found Congressional tweeting habits and content have changed very little in the last 8 years .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , they tended to use Twitter to pass along political information and links in addition to reporting on official and unofficial activities and meetings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss future spaces for research that go beyond content analysis into issues of motivation , communication , and impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The data show the more countries there are involved in the collaboration , the greater the gain in impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Contrary to what we expected , the scientific impact of a country does not significantly influence the benefit it derives from collaboration , but does seem to positively influence the benefit obtained by the other countries collaborating with it ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there was a weak correlation between these two classes of benefit , the countries with the highest impact were clear outliers from this correlation , tending to provide proportionally more benefit to their collaborating countries than they themselves obtained ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Two surprising Research findings/conclusions were the null benefit resulting from collaboration with Iran , and the small benefit resulting from collaboration with the United States despite its high impact ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous work on personalized search focuses on using the content of the user 's query and of the documents clicked to model the user 's preference .
Research questions	In this paper we focus on a different type of signal : We investigate the use of behavioral information for the Research questions of search personalization .
Research method	"That is , we consider clicks and dwell time for reranking an initially retrieved list of documents ."
Research method	"In particular , we ( i ) investigate the impact of distributions of users and queries on document reranking ; ( ii ) estimate the relevance of a document for a query at 2 levels , at the query-level and at the word-level , to alleviate the problem of sparseness ; and ( iii ) perform an experimental evaluation both for users seen during the training period and for users not seen during training ."
Research method	"For the latter , we explore the use of information from similar users who have been seen during the training period ."
Research method	"We use the dwell time on clicked documents to estimate a document 's relevance to a query , and perform Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization to generate a relevance distribution of a document over queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our experiments show that : ( i ) for personalized ranking , behavioral information helps to improve retrieval effectiveness ; and ( ii ) given a query , merging information inferred from behavior of a particular user and from behaviors of other users with a user-dependent adaptive weight outperforms any combination with a fixed weight ."
Research questions	Digital platforms increasingly allow these annotations to be shared in group and public environments .
Research method	"To explore scholars ' current behavior and attitudes toward shared annotations , semistructured interviews with 20 doctoral students were conducted ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions suggest that sociocognitive processes are integral to scholars ' creation and use of shared annotations .
Research questions	"However , although scholars clearly support creating and using shared annotations , several sociocognitive hurdles have hampered adoption of scholarly shared annotation systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article discusses common themes emerging from the Research findings/conclusions and relates them to research on shared annotations .
Research findings/conclusions	"In just one simple network map , we get the relevant citation environment of a specific seed journal ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It is of interest to librarians , publishers , scientists and science policy makers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These journal citation network maps are useful for these various stakeholders in and around the science system , as they provide information on the level of journal connections , unlike the more traditional structures such as the Journal Subject Categories , the classification system applied in the products of Thomson Reuters ( Journal Citation Reports , Web of Science , etc . ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These network maps show the closest relations journals can have , based on citation relations , suggesting influence relations between journals in such a way that traditional field boundaries are transcended ."
Research questions	Browsing a collection through LCSH is difficult using current online tools in part because users can not explore the structure using their existing experience navigating file hierarchies on their hard drives .
Research questions	"This is due to inconsistencies in the LCSH structure , which does not adhere to the specific rules defining tree structures ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article proposes a method to adapt the LCSH structure to reflect a real-world collection from the domain of science and engineering .
Research method	This structure is transformed into a valid tree structure using an automatic process .
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis of the resulting LCSH tree shows a large and complex structure .
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis of the distribution of information within the LCSH tree reveals a power law distribution where the vast majority of subjects contain few information items and a few subjects contain the vast majority of the collection .
Research method	"A hypernetwork for social tagging is constructed in which a tagging action is expressed as a hyperedge and the user , resource , and tag are expressed as nodes ."
Research method	"Quantitative measures for the constructed hypernetwork are defined , including the hyperdegree and its distribution , the excess average hyperdegree , and the hyperdegree conditional probability distribution ."
Research method	"Using the data set from Delicious , an empirical study was conducted ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The empirical results show that multiple individual tags and one or very few popular tags are generally employed together in one tagging action , and the usage patterns and regularities of tags with varying popularity are correlated to both user activity and resource interest ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The empirical results are further discussed and explained from the perspectives of tag functions and motivations .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , suggestions regarding the usage of various popular tags for both tagging users and service providers of social tagging are given ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article contributes something new to the conversation as the first arts-informed , visual , empirical study of information utilizing the draw-and-write technique ."
Research method	"To approach the concept of information afresh , graduate students at a North American iSchool were asked to respond to the question What is information ?"
Research method	"by drawing on a 4- by 4-inch piece of paper , called an iSquare ."
Research method	One hundred thirty-seven iSquares were produced and then analyzed using compositional interpretation combined with a theoretical framework of graphic representations .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate how students visualize information , what was drawn , and associations between the iSquares and prior renderings of information based on words ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the iSquares , information appears most often as pictures of people , artifacts , landscapes , and patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are also many link diagrams , grouping diagrams , symbols , and written text , each with distinct qualities ."
Research method	"Methodological reflections address the relationship between visual and textual data , and the sample for the study is critiqued ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A discussion presents new directions for theory and research on information , namely , the iSquares as a thinking tool , visual stories of information , and the contradictions of information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Ideas are also provided on the use of arts-informed , visual methods and the draw-and-write technique in the classroom ."
Research method	A researcher 's Nobel number for a given discipline in a given year is defined as the researcher 's average coauthorship distance to that discipline 's Nobel laureates in that year .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Plotting Nobel numbers over several decades provides a quantitative as well as visual indication of a researcher 's proximity to the intuitive center of a discipline as defined by recognized scientific achievement .
Research findings/conclusions	It is shown that the Nobel number distributions for physics of several researchers both within and outside of physics are surprisingly flat over the five-decade span from 1951 to 2000 .
Research findings/conclusions	A model in which Nobel laureates are typically connected by short coauthorship paths both intergenerationally and between subdisciplines reproduces such flat Nobel number distributions .
Research questions	"Peer production is prevalent for information products , which are the focus of the present study ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most research to date has focused on value as perceived by consumers , while consumers are increasingly involved in online processes of information production ."
Research questions	"Information , being intangible and experiential , is a unique type of good ."
Research questions	This study places participants in the position of producing or consuming information in order to assess effects of peer group size on value perceptions .
Research method	Six hundred and fifty one participants took part in 16 information consumption and production experiments .
Research findings/conclusions	Consumers read information and producers created the same information .
Research method	Consumers ' willingness-to-pay and producers ' willingness-to-accept payment were measured before or after peer consumption and production .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results indicate that value perception is highest when participants consume information individually , declining in small and medium-sized groups and growing in mass consumption ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Generally , post-consumption values are higher ."
Research method	"In production , point of measurement is cardinal ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Before production , value perceived individually is lowest , however , having experienced peer production , individuals ascribe the highest value to self-production ."
Research findings/conclusions	Value perceptions in massive groups converge .
Research questions	"However , operationalizations of disciplinarity often demarcate the boundaries of disciplines by standard classification schemes , which may be inflexible to changes in the participation profile of that discipline ."
Research method	"To address this limitation , a metric called venue-author-coupling ( VAC ) is proposed and illustrated using journals from the Journal Citation Report 's ( JCR ) library science and information science category ."
Research questions	"As JCRs are some of the most frequently used categories in bibliometric analyses , this allows for an examination of the extent to which the journals in JCR categories can be considered as proxies for disciplines ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By extending the idea of bibliographic coupling , VAC identifies similarities among journals based on the similarities of their author profiles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The employment of this method using information science and library science journals provides evidence of four distinct subfields , that is , management information systems , specialized information and library science , library science-focused , and information science-focused research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The proposed VAC method provides a novel way to examine disciplinarity from the perspective of author communities .
Research method	"The number and type of references that scientists include in their papers are analyzed , the relationship between the number of references and different impact-based indicators is studied from a multivariable perspective , and the referencing patterns of scientists are related to individual factors such as their age and scientific performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show inter-area differences in the number , type , and age of references ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Within each area , the number of references per document increases with journal impact factor and paper length ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Top-performance scientists use in their papers a higher number of references , which are more recent and more frequently covered by the Web of Science ."
Research findings/conclusions	Veteran researchers tend to rely more on older literature and non-Web of Science sources .
Research findings/conclusions	"The longer reference lists of top scientists can be explained by their tendency to publish in high impact factor journals , with stricter reference and reviewing requirements ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Long reference lists suggest a broader knowledge on the current literature in a field , which is important to become a top scientist ."
Research questions	"From the perspective of the handicap principle theory , the sustained use of a high number of references in an author 's oeuvre is a costly behavior that may indicate a serious , comprehensive , and solid research capacity , but that only the best researchers can afford ."
Research findings/conclusions	Boosting papers ' citations by artificially increasing the number of references does not seem a feasible strategy .
Research method	"Three algorithms are designed to study the macro-and micro-tag growth as well as the dynamics of taggers ' activities , respectively ."
Research questions	"Moreover , we propose a Tagger Tag Resource Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( TTR-LDA ) model to explore the evolution of topics emerging from those social vocabularies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that ( a ) at the macro level , tag growth in all the three tagging systems obeys power law distribution with exponents lower than 1 ; at the micro level , the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power law distribution ; ( b ) the exponents of tag growth vary in different evolving stages of resources ; ( c ) the growth of number of taggers associated with different popular resources presents a feature of convergence over time ; ( d ) the active level of taggers has a positive correlation with the macro-tag growth of different tagging systems ; and ( e ) some topics evolve into several subtopics over time while others experience relatively stable stages in which their contents do not change much , and certain groups of taggers continue their interests in them ."
Research questions	"The first repositories emerged in the early 1990s , and in some fields of science they have become an important channel for the dissemination of research results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"With quite strict inclusion criteria , 56 subject repositories were identified from a much larger number indexed in 2 repository indices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A closer study of these demonstrated a huge variety in sizes , organizational models , functions , and topics ."
Research questions	"When they first started to emerge , subject repositories catered to a strong market demand , but the later development of Internet search engines , the rapid growth of institutional repositories , and the tightening of journal publisher open access policies seems to be slowing their growth ."
Research method	"Kids , and Ask Kids on 30 queries that children formulated to find information for specific tasks ."
Research method	Retrieved hits on given queries were benchmarked to Google 's and Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Kids ' top-five ranked hits retrieved .
Research method	Relevancy of hits was judged on a graded scale ; precision was calculated using the precision-at-ten metric ( P @ 10 ) .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	"and Bing produced a similar percentage in hit overlap with Google ( nearly 30 % ) , but differed in the ranking of hits ."
Research findings/conclusions	Ask Kids retrieved 11 % in hit overlap with Google versus 3 % by Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Kids .
Research findings/conclusions	The engines retrieved 26 hits across query clusters that overlapped with Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Kids ' top-five ranked hits .
Research findings/conclusions	"Precision ( P ) that the engines produced across the queries was P ? = ? 0.48 for relevant hits , and P ? = ? 0.28 for partially relevant hits ."
Research method	Precision by Ask Kids was P ? = ? 0.44 for relevant hits versus P ? = ? 0.21 by Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Kids .
Research findings/conclusions	"Bing produced the highest total precision ( TP ) of relevant hits ( TP ? = ? 0.86 ) across the queries , and Yahoo !"
Research findings/conclusions	Kids yielded the lowest ( TP ? = ? 0.47 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Average precision ( AP ) of relevant hits was AP ? = ? 0.56 by leading engines versus AP ? = ? 0.29 by small engines .
Research findings/conclusions	"In contrast , average precision of partially relevant hits was AP ? = ? 0.83 by small engines versus AP ? = ? 0.33 by leading engines ."
Research findings/conclusions	Average precision of relevant hits across the engines was highest on two-word queries and lowest on one-word queries .
Research findings/conclusions	Google performed best on natural language queries ; Bing did the same ( P ? = ? 0.69 ) on two-word queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions have implications for search engine ranking algorithms , relevance theory , search engine design , research design , and information literacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The last of these controversially discounts the novelty , significance , and relevance of submitted articles and assesses only their soundness ."
Research method	"This article reports the results of an international survey of authors ( n = 11,883 ) , comparing the responses of OAMJ authors with those of other OA and subscription journals , and drawing comparisons between different OAMJs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Strikingly , OAMJ authors showed a low understanding of soundness-only peer review : two-thirds believed OAMJs took into account novelty , significance , and relevance , although there were marked geographical variations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Author satisfaction with OAMJs , however , was high , with more than 80 % of OAMJ authors saying they would publish again in the same journal , although there were variations by title , and levels were slightly lower than subscription journals ( over 90 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Their reasons for choosing to publish in OAMJs included a wide variety of factors , not significantly different from reasons given by authors of other journals , with the most important including the quality of the journal and quality of peer review ."
Research findings/conclusions	About half of OAMJ articles had been submitted elsewhere before submission to the OAMJ with some evidence of a cascade of articles between journals from the same publisher .
Research questions	"Consequently , questions such as how users ' intentions , task goals , and substances of the users ' tasks affect search behavior , as well as what triggers information needs , remain largely unanswered ."
Research method	We report an experiment in which naturalistic information search behavior was captured by analyzing 24/7 continuous recordings of information on participants ' computer screens .
Research method	Written task diaries describing the participants ' tasks were collected and used as real-life task contexts for further categorization .
Research method	"All search tasks were extracted and classified under various task categories according to users ' intentions , task goals , and substances of the tasks ."
Research method	"We investigated the effect of different task categories on three behavioral factors : search efforts , content-triggers , and application context ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results suggest four Research findings/conclusions : ( i ) Search activity is integrally associated with the users ' creative processes .
Research questions	"The content users have seen prior to searching more often triggers search , and is used as a query , within creative tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"( ii ) Searching within intellectual and creative tasks is more time-intensive , while search activity occurring as a part of daily routine tasks is associated with more frequent searching within a search task ."
Research findings/conclusions	( iii ) Searching is more often induced from utility applications in tasks demanding a degree of intellectual effort .
Research findings/conclusions	( iv ) Users ' leisure information-seeking activity is occurring inherently within social media services or comes from social communication platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	The implications of our Research findings/conclusions for information access and management systems are discussed .
Research method	"After exploring the theoretical properties of these indices , we studied two cases : 57 library and information science ( LIS ) journals and social science research in 38 European countries/territories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results reveal that there are approximate power-law relations between distributive h-indices and some underlying citation indicators , such as total citations , total citing entities , and the h-index ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Distributive h-indices provide comprehensive measures for multilevel impact , and lead to a potential tool for citation analysis , particularly at aggregative levels ."
Research findings/conclusions	These measures can in turn be used to determine an author 's overall prominence in the corpus and to identify distinct schools of thought .
Research method	We apply our methods to two major historical corpora .
Research method	"Using scholarly consensus as a gold standard , we demonstrate empirically the superiority of indirect influence over direct influence as a basis for various measures of authorial impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	Only a few will burst and become trending topics .
Research method	"In this article , we provide the definition of a bursting hashtag and conduct a systematic study of a series of challenging prediction problems that span the entire life cycles of bursting hashtags ."
Research questions	"Around the problem of how to build a system to predict bursting hashtags , we explore different types of features and present machine learning solutions ."
Research method	"On real data sets from Twitter , experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and the contributions of features ."
Research questions	Interactive features are now integral parts of web search engines .
Research questions	"However , generating good query modification suggestions remains a challenging issue ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Query log analysis is one of the major strands of work in this direction .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although much research has been performed on query logs collected on the web as a whole , query log analysis to enhance search on smaller and more focused collections has attracted less attention , despite its increasing practical importance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we report on a systematic study of different query modification methods applied to a substantial query log collected on a local website that already uses an interactive search engine ."
Research method	We conducted experiments in which we asked users to assess the relevance of potential query modification suggestions that have been constructed using a range of log analysis methods and different baseline approaches .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of log analysis to extract query modification suggestions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , our experiments demonstrate that a more fine-grained approach than grouping search requests into sessions allows for extraction of better refinement terms from query log files ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also expect that the level of novelty and relevancy should be acknowledged .
Research findings/conclusions	"Accordingly , we expect that the evaluation algorithm would reward rankings that respect these expectations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Nevertheless , there are few research articles in the literature that study how to meet such expectations , even fewer in the field of biomedical information retrieval ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we propose a new metric for novelty and relevancy evaluation in biomedical information retrieval based on an aspect-level performance measure introduced by TREC Genomics Track with formal results to show that those expectations above can be respected under ideal conditions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed metric , geNov , is greatly sensitive to the desired characteristics above , and the three parameters are highly tuneable for different evaluation preferences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By experimentally comparing with state-of-the-art metrics for novelty and diversity , the proposed metric shows its advantages in recognizing the ranking quality in terms of novelty , redundancy , relevancy , and irrelevancy and in its discriminative power ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments reveal the proposed metric is faster to compute than state-of-the-art metrics .
Research findings/conclusions	Better understanding of the mental models of taggers and experts and their usage gap may inspire better selection of appropriate keywords for organizing information resources .
Research method	"Using a data set of 3,972 tags from CiteULike and 6,708 descriptors from Library and Information Science Abstracts ( LISA ) from 1,489 scholarly articles of 13 library and information science journals , social network analysis and frequent-pattern tree methods were used to capture and build up the mental models of article indexing of taggers and experts when using keywords , and to generalize their structures and patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When measured with respect to the terms used , a power-law distribution , a comparison of terms used as tags and descriptors , social network analysis ( including centrality , overall structure , and role equivalent ) and frequent-pattern tree analysis , little similarity was found between the mental models of taggers and experts ."
Research findings/conclusions	Twenty-five patterns of path-based rules and 12 identical rules of frequent-pattern trees were shared by taggers and experts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Title-and topic-related keyword categories were the most popular keyword categories used in path-based rules of frequent-pattern trees , and also the most popular members of 25 patterns and the starting point of the 12 identical rules ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Given their proliferation in jurisdictions such as Canada , Australia , the United Kingdom , and other European countries , such an absence is notable but not unexpected given the political sensitivities attached to them ."
Research questions	"These programs remain an emerging policy area which is still finding its feet , around which their legitimacy and efficacy is keenly debated ."
Research questions	This paper argues for adopting theoretical principles drawn from information science research based upon information behavior models to provide a framework for the design and development of such programs and against which their efficacy can be tested .
Research method	"We demonstrate how this approach can be applied through thematic analysis of the theory of change models of EPVE programs implemented in England and Wales , designed to increase awareness and understanding of radicalization among young people , their carers , and professionals ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article is ground breaking and of international significance , being the first to apply learning from information science to practice in furthering policy goals around countering radicalization and extremism in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions ."
Research findings/conclusions	We report the Research findings/conclusions of three studies .
Research method	"First , we conducted a large-scale classification study ( similar to 50,000 queries ) using a crowdsourcing approach ."
Research method	"Next , we used clickthrough data from a search engine log and validated the judgments given by the jurors from the crowdsourcing study ."
Research method	"Finally , we conducted an online survey on a commercial search engine 's portal ."
Research method	"Because we used the same queries for all three studies , we also were able to compare the results and the effectiveness of the different approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that neither the crowdsourcing approach , using jurors who classified queries originating from other users , nor the questionnaire approach , using searchers who were asked about their own query that they just entered into a Web search engine , led to satisfying results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This leads us to conclude that there was little understanding of the classification tasks , even though both groups of jurors were given detailed instructions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although we used manual classification , our research also has important implications for automatic classification ."
Research findings/conclusions	We must question the success of approaches using automatic classification and comparing its performance to a baseline from human jurors .
Research questions	"In a knowledge-intensive environment , knowledge workers need to access task-related codified knowledge ( documents ) to perform tasks ."
Research questions	A worker 's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow ( KF ) to represent the evolution of his or her information needs over time .
Research findings/conclusions	Document recommendation methods can proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs .
Research questions	"However , most traditional recommendation methods do not consider workers KFs or the information needs of the majority of a group of workers with similar KFs ."
Research findings/conclusions	A group 's needs may partially reflect the needs of an individual worker that can not be inferred from his or her past referencing behavior .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In other words , the group 's knowledge complements that of the individual worker ."
Research questions	"Thus , we leverage the group perspective to complement the personal perspective by using hybrid approaches , which combine the KF-based group recommendation method ( KFGR ) with traditional personalized-recommendation methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed hybrid methods achieve a trade-off between the group-based and personalized methods by exploiting the strengths of both .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of our experiment show that the proposed methods can enhance the quality of recommendations made by traditional methods .
Research questions	"Recently , boundaries between the two paradigms have narrowed and hybrid approaches are gaining interest from both academia and businesses ."
Research questions	"However , since hybrid approaches involve the multidisciplinary interaction of linguists , computer scientists , engineers , and information specialists , understandably a number of issues exist ."
Research questions	"While statistical methods currently dominate research work in MT , most commercial MT systems are technically hybrid systems ."
Research findings/conclusions	The research community should investigate the benefits and questions surrounding the hybridization of MT systems more actively .
Research questions	"This paper discusses various issues related to hybrid MT including its origins , architectures , achievements , and frustrations experienced in the community ."
Research findings/conclusions	It can be said that both rule-based and corpus- based MT systems have benefited from hybridization when effectively integrated .
Research questions	"In fact , many of the current rule/corpus-based MT approaches are already hybridized since they do include statistics/rules at some point ."
Research findings/conclusions	Wikipedia is a clear example of these new options .
Research questions	"It is a gigantic open repository of knowledge , and it can also be considered a platform that facilitates collaboration in knowledge creation and dissemination ."
Research questions	Our research objective is to understand what the main factors are that influence the teaching uses of Wikipedia among university faculty .
Research method	"Based on a technology acceptance model , and using data from a survey sent to all faculty members of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya , we analyze the relationships within the internal and external constructs of the model ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that both the perception of colleagues ' opinions about Wikipedia and the perceived quality of the information in Wikipedia play a central role .
Research findings/conclusions	These two constructs have a significant direct impact on the perceived usefulness of Wikipedia .
Research findings/conclusions	"This perceived usefulness affects , mediated by the behavioral intention of using Wikipedia , the effective use behavior of the encyclopedia ."
Research findings/conclusions	The degree to which an individual considers it is important to participate in open collaborative environments and the Web 2.0 profile of the faculty members also play an important role in our model .
Research method	"The maps are based on the 10,000+ journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports ( JCR ) of the Science and Social Sciences Citation Indices ( 2011 ) ."
Research method	"The disciplinary diversity of the retrieval is measured in terms of Rao-Stirling 's quadratic entropy ( Izsak & Papp , 1995 ) ."
Research method	"Since this indicator of interdisciplinarity is normalized between 0 and 1 , interdisciplinarity can be compared among document sets and across years , cited or citing ."
Research method	"The colors used for the overlays are based on Blondel , Guillaume , Lambiotte , and Lefebvre 's ( 2008 ) community-finding algorithms operating on the relations among journals included in the JCR ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results can be exported from VOSViewer with different options such as proportional labels , heat maps , or cluster density maps ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The maps can also be web-started or animated ( e.g. , using PowerPoint ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The citing dimension of the aggregated journal-journal citation matrix was found to provide a more comprehensive description than the matrix based on the cited archive .
Research findings/conclusions	The relations between local and global maps and their different functions in studying the sciences in terms of journal literatures are further discussed : Local and global maps are based on different assumptions and can be expected to serve different Research questionss for the explanation .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We address the research gap by modeling the factors that drive public acceptance of government surveillance , and by exploring the influence of national culture ."
Research method	The research involved an online survey of 242 Australian and Sri Lankan residents .
Research findings/conclusions	"Data were analyzed using partial least squares , revealing that privacy concerns around initial collection of citizens ' data influenced levels of acceptance of surveillance in Australia but not Sri Lanka , whereas concerns about secondary use of data did not influence levels of acceptance in either country ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions suggest that respondents conflate surveillance with the collection of data and may not consider subsequent secondary use .
Research questions	"We also investigate cultural differences , finding that societal collectivism and power distance significantly affect the strength of the relationships between privacy concerns and acceptance of surveillance , on the one hand , and adoption of privacy protections , on the other ."
Research questions	"Our research also considers the role of trust in government , and perceived need for surveillance ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions are discussed with their implications for theory and practice .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study attempts to fill this gap by observing users ' behavior while using MedlinePlus to search for specific health information .
Research method	"Nineteen students participated in the study , and each performed 12 specific tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"During the search process , they submitted short queries or complete questions , and they examined less than 1 result per search ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants rarely reformulated queries ; when they did , they tended to make a query more specific or more general , or iterate in different ways ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants also browsed , primarily relying on the alphabetical list and the anatomical classification , to navigate to specific health topics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants overall had a positive experience with MedlinePlus , and the experience was significantly correlated with task difficulty and participants ' spatial abilities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that , to better support specific item search in the health domain , systems could provide a more natural interface to encourage users to ask questions ; effective conceptual hierarchies could be implemented to help users reformulate queries ; and the search results page should be reconceptualized as a place for accessing answers rather than documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , multiple schemas should be provided to help users navigate to a health topic ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results also suggest that users ' experience with information systems in general and health-related systems in particular should be evaluated in relation to contextual factors , such as task features and individual differences ."
Research questions	"When these caveats are overlooked , programming errors may emerge from misusing APIs , leading to heavy discussions on Q & A websites like Stack Overflow ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If the overlooked caveats could be mined from these discussions , they would be beneficial for programmers to avoid misuse of APIs ."
Research questions	"However , it is challenging because the discussions are informal , redundant , and diverse ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"For this , for example , we propose Disca , a novel approach for automatically Distilling desirable API negative caveats from unstructured Q & A discussions ."
Research method	"Through sentence selection and prominent term clustering , Disca ensures that distilled caveats are context-independent , prominent , semantically diverse , and nonredundant ."
Research findings/conclusions	Quantitative evaluation in our experiments shows that the proposed Disca significantly outperforms four text-summarization techniques .
Research findings/conclusions	We also show that the distilled API negative caveats could greatly augment API documentation through qualitative analysis .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Far less research has addressed the unique problems of research planning .
Research findings/conclusions	Models and maps of science that can address the detailed problems associated with research planning are needed .
Research method	This article reports on the creation of an article-level model and map of science covering 16 years and nearly 20 million articles using cocitation-based techniques .
Research method	The map is then used to define discipline-like structures consisting of natural groupings of articles and clusters of articles .
Research findings/conclusions	This combination of detail and high-level structure can be used to address planning-related problems such as identification of emerging topics and the identification of which areas of science and technology are innovative and which are simply persisting .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition to presenting the model and map , several process improvements that result in greater accuracy structures are detailed , including a bibliographic coupling approach for assigning current papers to cocitation clusters and a sequential hybrid approach to producing visual maps from models ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , the Times Higher Education World University Rankings are , among other things , based on this operationalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , WCs were developed decades ago for the Research questions of information retrieval and evolved incrementally with the database ; the classification is machine-based and partially manually corrected ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using the WC information science & library science and the WCs attributed to journals in the field of science and technology studies , we show that WCs do not provide sufficient analytical clarity to carry bibliometric normalization in evaluation practices because of indexer effects ."
Research questions	Can the compliance with best practices be replaced with an ambition to develop best possible practices ?
Research findings/conclusions	New research questions can then be envisaged .
Research questions	Such inventor networks are usually large and complex .
Research method	"This study proposes a multidimensional network analysis framework that utilizes Exponential Random Graph Models ( ERGMs ) to simultaneously model knowledge-sharing and knowledge-transfer processes , examine their interactions , and evaluate the impacts of network structures and public funding on knowledge-diffusion networks ."
Research method	Experiments are conducted on a longitudinal data set that covers 2 decades ( 1991-2010 ) of nanotechnology-related US Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) patents .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer are closely interrelated .
Research findings/conclusions	"High degree centrality or boundary inventors play significant roles in the network , and National Science Foundation ( NSF ) public funding positively affects knowledge sharing despite its small fraction in overall funding and upstream research topics ."
Research method	"A mixed research method that combines the social network analysis method , clustering analysis method , and inferential analysis methods was used ."
Research findings/conclusions	The clustering analysis results of the link connection network were quite different from those of the semantic connection network .
Research findings/conclusions	There were significant differences between the link connection network and the semantic network in terms of density and centrality .
Research findings/conclusions	Inferential analysis results show that there were no strong correlations between the centrality of a node and its topic information characteristics .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Suggestions for enhancing the navigation guidance system are discussed in detail .
Research findings/conclusions	"Future research directions , such as application of the same research method presented in this study to other similar public health portals , are also included ."
Research method	This review explores the data retrieval literature to identify commonalities in how users search for and evaluate observational research data in selected disciplines .
Research method	"Two analytical frameworks , rooted in information retrieval and science and technology studies , are used to identify key similarities in practices as a first step toward developing a model describing data retrieval ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These tools need to be efficiently adapted and in most cases translated to allow them to be utilized in other cultures , languages , and countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To date , there have been no standard guidelines to adapt these tools ; hence , the results may be cross-culturally generalized to a certain extent ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , most data analyses produce generic outcomes without taking into account the ability of the students , including the difficulty of the test items ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The present study proposes a systematic approach for context adaptation and language translation of the preexisting IL assessment tool known as TRAILS-9 to be used in different languages and context , particularly a Malaysian public secondary school ."
Research method	"This study further administers a less common psychometric approach , the Rasch analysis , to validate the adapted instrument ."
Research findings/conclusions	This technique produces a hierarchy of item difficulty within the assessment domain that enables the ability level of the students to be differentiated based on item difficulty .
Research findings/conclusions	The recommended scale adaptation guidelines are able to reduce the misinterpretation of scores from instruments in multiple languages as well as contribute to parallel development of IL assessment among secondary school students from different populations .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The analysis distinguishes high quality from standard quality articles and focuses on the question whether communicating acceptance rates rather than rejection rates leads to other submission decisions .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that a positive framing effect might be present when authors decide on submitting a high quality article .
Research findings/conclusions	No evidence of a framing effect is found when authors consider a standard quality article .
Research findings/conclusions	"From a journal marketing perspective , this is important information for editors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Communicating acceptance rates rather than rejection rates might help to convince researchers to submit to their journal .
Research findings/conclusions	"While the idealized IE process involves engaging with information after noticing it ( for example , by examining it , conducting follow-up seeking to determine usefulness , then using or sharing it ) , the process can be disrupted-resulting in missed opportunities for knowledge and insight creation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study provides a detailed understanding of when and why the process can be disrupted .
Research method	"Think-aloud observations and Critical Incident Interviews were conducted with 15 web users , focusing on examining when they encountered information but did not engage with it ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Factors that discouraged engagement and simultaneously encouraged participants to return to active , goal-directed information seeking by disrupting the IE process were identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These factors individually and collectively demonstrate that IE can instigate a highly uncertain cost-benefit trade-off , sometimes resulting in encounterers being cautious by returning to less risky active seeking ."
Research findings/conclusions	Design suggestions are made for reducing the uncertainty of deciding whether to engage with encountered information and making it easier to return to the active seeking task if disruption occurs .
Research questions	"It also examines the development of LIS from 1965 to 2005 in light of comparable data sets for 1965 , 1985 , and 2005 ."
Research method	"In both cases , the authors report ( a ) how the research articles are distributed by topic and ( b ) what approaches , research strategies , and methods were applied in the articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In 2005 , the largest research areas in LIS by this measure were information storage and retrieval , scientific communication , library and information-service activities , and information seeking ."
Research method	The same research areas constituted the quantitative core of LIS in the previous years since 1965 .
Research questions	Information retrieval has been the most popular area of research over the years .
Research findings/conclusions	"The proportion of research on library and information-service activities decreased after 1985 , but the popularity of information seeking and of scientific communication grew during the period studied ."
Research questions	The viewpoint of research has shifted from library and information organizations to end users and development of systems for the latter .
Research findings/conclusions	"The proportion of empirical research strategies was high and rose over time , with the survey method being the single most important method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , attention to evaluation and experiments increased considerably after 1985 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Conceptual research strategies and system analysis , description , and design were quite popular , but declining ."
Research findings/conclusions	The most significant changes from 1965 to 2005 are the decreasing interest in library and information-service activities and the growth of research into information seeking and scientific communication .
Research questions	"The network structure of communication is considered to affect team and individual performances , but it has not been not empirically tested ."
Research method	"In this article , we collected a set of 1-month e-mail logs of a company and conducted an e-mail network analysis ."
Research method	"We calculated the network centralities of 72 managerial candidates , and investigated the relationship between positions in the network and leadership performance with partial least squares structural equation modeling ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Betweenness and in-degree network centralities of those middle managers are correlated with their leadership performance ; on the other hand , for this management group , out-degree has no correlation , and Page Rank is a negative indicator of leadership ."
Research questions	Leaders with high performance are trusted in their communities as a hub of the information channel of the communication network .
Research findings/conclusions	"Because mobile devices have relatively small screens and show fewer search results , search behavior with mobile devices may be different from that with desktops or laptops ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , examining these differences may suggest better , more efficient designs for mobile search engines ."
Research method	"In this experiment , we use eye tracking to explore user behavior and performance ."
Research method	We analyze web searches with 2 task types on 2 differently sized screens : one for a desktop and the other for a mobile device .
Research questions	"In addition , we examine the relationships between search performance and several search behaviors to allow further investigation of the differences engendered by the screens ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that users have more difficulty extracting information from search results pages on the smaller screens , although they exhibit less eye movement as a result of an infrequent use of the scroll function ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , in terms of search performance , our Research findings/conclusions suggest that there is no significant difference between the 2 screens in time spent on search results pages and the accuracy of finding answers ."
Research findings/conclusions	This suggests several possible ideas for the presentation design of search results pages on small devices .
Research questions	"To navigate this landscape and drive innovations , Virginia Tech launched the strategic development of Intelligent Infrastructure for Human Centered Communities or IIHCC ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is timely to study the integrative design process and transdisciplinary discourse for the smart future .
Research method	"This study employed qualitative research methods including ethnographic participant observation , document analysis , and semistructured interviews ."
Research method	"The mixed-methods approach is especially useful for capturing typical scenarios , emergent issues , and practical examples surrounding the smart infrastructure endeavors and the array of challenges and creative frictions encountered ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Taking a sociotechnical perspective , this study explored how IIHCC can achieve significant program synergies and inspire new collaborations across intellectual boundaries ."
Research questions	"Furthermore , it investigated how libraries can work collaboratively and constructively with the community to build a stimulating culture of a transdisciplinary mechanism and collective intelligence ."
Research questions	"Tying all these together , the study then discusses how we can achieve a synergistic discourse by way of data as distinct unifiers for cross-domain collaborations ."
Research questions	It concludes by presenting multidimensional opportunities and multispectral engagement for libraries to potentially chart a new course and become a driving force in this evolution .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study focuses on the most ubiquitous of these technologies , e-mail , and unobtrusively explores the ongoing inbox-management activities of thousands of users worldwide over a period of 8 months ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study describes the dynamics of these inboxes throughout the day and the week as users strive to handle incoming messages , read them , classify them , respond to them in a timely manner , and archive them for future reference , all while carrying out the daily tasks of knowledge workers ."
Research method	"It then tests several hypotheses about the influence of specific inbox-management behaviors in mitigating the causes of e-mail overload , and proposes a continuous index that quantifies one of these inbox-management behaviors ."
Research questions	"This inbox clearing index ( ICI ) expands on the widely cited trichotomous classification of users into frequent filers , spring cleaners , and no filers , as suggested by Whittaker and Sidner ( 1996 ) ."
Research questions	"We propose that the ICI allows shifting the focus , from classifying users to characterizing a diversity of user behaviors and measuring the relationships between these behaviors and desired outcomes ."
Research questions	"Unfortunately , many authors avoid listing sufficient keywords for their papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As such , these applications may need to automatically associate good descriptive keywords with papers ."
Research method	When the full text of the paper is available this problem has been thoroughly studied .
Research questions	"In many cases , however , due to copyright limitations , research databases do not have access to the full text ."
Research questions	"On the other hand , such databases typically maintain metadata , such as the title and abstract and the citation network of each paper ."
Research method	"In this paper we study the problem of predicting which keywords are appropriate for a research paper , using different methods based on the citation network and available metadata ."
Research questions	Our main goal is in providing search engines with the ability to extract keywords from the available metadata .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , our system can also be used for other applications , such as for recommending keywords for the authors of new papers ."
Research method	"We create a data set of research papers , and their citation network , keywords , and other metadata , containing over 470K papers with and more than 2 million keywords ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We compare our methods with predicting keywords using the title and abstract , in offline experiments and in a user study , concluding that the citation network provides much better predictions ."
Research questions	"Facilitated by digitization of the patent data and increasing computing power , a community of practice has grown up that has developed methods for using these data to : measure attributes of innovations such as impact and originality ; to trace flows of knowledge across individuals , institutions and regions ; and to map innovation networks ."
Research questions	The objective of this article is threefold .
Research method	"First , it takes stock of these main uses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , it discusses 4 pitfalls associated with patent citation data , related to office , time and technology , examiner , and strategic effects ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Third , it highlights gaps in our understanding and offers directions for future research ."
Research method	"This article focuses on one particular group of ICT professionals , computational modelers , and explores how these ICT professionals perceive their own societal responsibilities ."
Research method	"Specifically , the article uses a mixed-method approach to look at the role of professional codes of ethics and explores the relationship between modelers ' experiences with , and attitudes toward , codes of ethics and their values ."
Research findings/conclusions	Statistical analysis of survey data reveals a relationship between modelers ' values and their attitudes and experiences related to codes of ethics .
Research findings/conclusions	Thematic analysis of interviews with a subset of survey participants identifies two key themes : that modelers should be faithful to the reality and values of users and that codes of ethics should be built from the bottom up .
Research findings/conclusions	"One important implication of the research is that those who value universalism and benevolence may have a particular duty to act on their values and advocate for , and work to develop , a code of ethics ."
Research questions	"With the development of new data models and computer technologies , the need for new approaches to present and interact with bibliographic data has slowly been maturing ."
Research method	"To investigate how this could be accomplished , a prototype system , FrbrVis 1 , was designed to present work families within a bibliographic information system using information visualization ."
Research method	"This paper reports on two user studies , a controlled and an observational experiment , that have been carried out to assess the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ( FRBR ) -based against an existing system as well as to test four different hierarchical visual layouts ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results clearly show that FrbrVis offers better performance and user experience compared to the baseline system .
Research findings/conclusions	"The differences between the four hierarchical visualizations ( Indented tree , Radial tree , Circlepack , and Sunburst ) were , on the other hand , not as pronounced , but the Indented tree and Sunburst design proved to be the most successful , both in performance as well as user perception ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The paper therefore not only evaluates the application of a visual presentation of bib-liographic work families , but also provides valuable results regarding the performance and user acceptance of individual hierarchical visualization techniques ."
Research questions	"A range of platforms , such as academic social networking sites ( SNS ) , are geared specifically towards the academic community ."
Research questions	Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment .
Research questions	Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact .
Research questions	We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers ' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact .
Research method	"Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars , we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants ' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional , offline impact indicators ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that platform engagement , seniority , and publication impact contribute to members ' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform , but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS , while subject to platform-specific dynamics , may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Expert finding has been studied extensively , with less attention going to the complementary task of expert profiling , that is , automatically identifying topics about which a person is knowledgeable ."
Research method	We describe a test collection for expert profiling in which expert users have self-selected their knowledge areas .
Research method	"Motivated by the sparseness of this set of knowledge areas , we report on an assessment experiment in which academic experts judge a profile that has been automatically generated by state-of-the-art expert-profiling algorithms ; optionally , experts can indicate a level of expertise for relevant areas ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experts may also give feedback on the quality of the system-generated knowledge areas .
Research method	We report on a content analysis of these comments and gain insights into what aspects of profiles matter to experts .
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide an error analysis of the system-generated profiles , identifying factors that help explain why certain experts may be harder to profile than others ."
Research method	We also analyze the impact on evaluating expert-profiling systems of using self-selected versus judged system-generated knowledge areas as ground truth ; they rank systems somewhat differently but detect about the same amount of pairwise significant differences despite the fact that the judged system-generated assessments are more sparse .
Research method	"Drawing on interviews with 26 participants , all of whom had moved to New York City in the past 2 years , I analyze the interrelatedness of people , city space , and technology ."
Research questions	"By rooting my analysis in the experiences of transnational newcomers to New York , my investigation is directed both at library and information science ( LIS ) scholarship in transnational experience and urban informatics as an area of study ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The Research findings/conclusions section first addresses participants ' practices for becoming familiar with their surroundings as embedded in everyday routines using Bergson 's ( 1911 ) construct of habits as a means of organizing stimulus .
Research method	"I then develop an analysis of wandering , which emerged as an information practice used by participants to become familiar with their neighborhoods ."
Research questions	"Building on these themes , I suggest implications for human information behavior theory , arguing that LIS scholars should articulate more clearly and across a wider range of disciplines the concepts of mobile and ubiquitous technologies ."
Research questions	"Opinion mining , also known as sentiment analysis , has received a lot of attention in recent times , as it provides a number of tools to analyze public opinion on a number of different topics ."
Research questions	"Comparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining which deals with identifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form ( e.g. , paper X is better than the Y ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Comparative opinion mining plays a very important role when one tries to evaluate something because it provides a reference point for the comparison .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper provides a review of the area of comparative opinion mining .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is the first review that cover specifically this topic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining .
Research method	This survey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles .
Research method	One from the perspective of techniques and the other from the perspective of comparative opinion elements .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as data set that were used by past researchers that can be useful to future researchers in the field of comparative opinion mining .
Research questions	"Wittfogel 's ( 1957 ) Eastern autocracy states that 2 environmental dimensions , rainfall and sea border , influence the origin of democracy ."
Research method	"This study examined Wittfogel 's Eastern autocracy theory through statistical analysis of average annual precipitation , land boundaries , latitudes , and annual temperature of 196 countries and territories with their freedom levels defined by Freedom House , to find out the correlations between these geospatial factors and democracy ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , this study extended its investigation to web interface design by examining democracy represented on college/university websites in correlations with these geospatial factors ."
Research method	A total of 130 college/university websites selected from 65 countries were coded and examined systematically in linear and multiple regression analyses .
Research findings/conclusions	"This study concluded that democracy correlates positively with annual precipitation and latitude , but negatively with land boundaries and annual temperature ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , this study indicated that these 4 geospatial variables associate with democracy represented on web interface design , although the associations are not statistically significant ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study also suggested that it is more accurate to predict democracy if the 4 geospatial factors are considered together as dependent variables .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By examining Wittfogel 's theory of hydraulic civilization on web interface design , this study not only extended its sociological perspective to the information science arena , but also provided a better understanding of the functionality of the Internet in information dissemination and its cultural and sociological aspects ."
Research questions	"Drawing on the theory of impression management , we hypothesize and explain when and why consumers choose to post their comments on different platforms , and how their behavior will be affected when they choose to post on online platforms ."
Research method	"To test the hypotheses , we collected and text-mined online posts from product platforms such as review aggregator sites , discussion forums , and consumer rating websites , and non-product platforms such as microblogs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that product platforms have more polarized opinions , and exhibit more convergence in opinion across time , compared with non-product platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions advise researchers and practitioners to pay attention to the characteristics of online platforms , and how users ' perceptions of the Research questions of the online platform may affect their online posting behavior ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This expansion reflects that increasingly , smart systems request input from users without having been prompted by them , which is the essence of the existing interaction types ."
Research questions	Systems utilizing the Responding interaction type proactively seek input from users in situations where said input is required .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , users can not sufficiently distinguish organic results from advertisements , resulting in result selections under false assumptions ."
Research questions	"Following on from that , this study examines how users ' understanding of search-based advertising influences their viewing and selection behavior on desktop computer and smartphone ."
Research method	"To investigate this , we used a mixed methods approach ( n= 100 ) consisting of a pre-study interview , an eye-tracking experiment , and a post-study questionnaire ."
Research findings/conclusions	We show that participants with a low level of knowledge on search advertising are more likely to click on ads than subjects with a high level of knowledge .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , subjects with little knowledge show less willingness to scroll down to organic results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Regarding the device , there are significant differences in viewing behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	These can be attributed to the influence of the direct visibility of search results on both devices tested : Ads that were ranked on top received significantly more visual attention on the small screen than the top ranked ads on the large screen .
Research findings/conclusions	The results call for a clearer labeling of advertisements and for the promotion of users ' information literacy .
Research findings/conclusions	Future studies should investigate the motivations of searchers when clicking on ads .
Research questions	Molecular medicine is a relevant domain because it offers thousands of digital resources as the information environment .
Research method	Data were collected through shadowing of real work tasks .
Research method	Thirty work task sessions were analyzed and barriers in these identified .
Research method	"The barriers were classified by their character ( conceptual , syntactic , and technological ) and by their context of appearance ( work task , system integration , or system ) ."
Research method	"Also , work task sessions were grouped into three complexity classes and the frequency of barriers of varying types across task complexity levels were analyzed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions indicate that although most of the barriers are on system level , there is a quantum of barriers in integration and work task contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	These barriers might be overcome through attention to the integrated use of multiple systems at least for the most frequent uses .
Research findings/conclusions	"This can be done by means of standardization and harmonization of the data and by taking the requirements of the work tasks into account in system design and development , because information access is seldom an end itself , but rather serves to reach the goals of work tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that the content-based method is appropriate to serve as a basis for the session identification in our domain .
Research questions	"However , there remain some problems reported in previous research which degrade the identification performance ( such as accuracy ) of the content-based method ."
Research questions	"Therefore , in this article , we propose two important refinements to address these problems ."
Research findings/conclusions	We describe the underlying rationale of our refinements and then empirically show that the content-based method equipped with our refinements is able to achieve an excellent identification performance in our domain ( such as 99.820 % accuracy and 99.707 % F-measure in our experiments ) .
Research method	"Next , because the time-based method has extremely low computation costs , which makes it suitable for many real-world applications , we investigate the feasibility of the time-based method in our domain by evaluating its identification performance based on our refined content-based method ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our experiments demonstrate that the performance of the time-based method is potentially acceptable to many real applications in our domain .
Research method	"Finally , we analyze several features of the identified sessions in our domain and compare them with the corresponding ones in general web search ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results illustrate the profession-oriented characteristics of our domain .
Research questions	"This article examines the Quacquarelli Symonds ( QS ) World University Ranking methodology , pointing to a drawback of using subjective , possibly biased , weightings to build a composite indicator ( QS scores ) ."
Research questions	"We propose an alternative approach to creating QS scores , which is referred to as the composite I-distance indicator ( CIDI ) methodology ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main contribution is the proposal of a composite indicator weights correction based on the CIDI methodology .
Research findings/conclusions	It leads to the improved stability and reduced uncertainty of the QS ranking system .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The CIDI methodology is also applicable to other university rankings by proposing a specific statistical approach to creating a composite indicator .
Research questions	"Long delays often cause users to abandon their searches , but how do tolerable delays affect information search behavior ?"
Research findings/conclusions	"Intuitively , we would expect that tolerable delays should induce decreased information search ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conducted two experiments and found that as delay increased , a point occurs at which time within-page information search increases ; that is , search behavior remained the same until a tipping point occurs where delay increases the depth of search ."
Research questions	"We argue that situation normality explains this phenomenon ; users have become accustomed to tolerable delays up to a point ( our research suggests between 7 and 11s ) , after which search behavior changes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"That is , some delay is expected , but as delay becomes noticeable but not long enough to cause the abandonment of search , an increase occurs in the stickiness of webpages such that users examine more information on each page before moving to new pages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The net impact of tolerable delays was counterintuitive : tolerable delays had no impact on the total amount of data searched in the first experiment , but induced users to examine more data points in the second experiment ."
Research method	"by comparing the meaning of the term information and epistemological assumptions of three theories in library and information science : the ShannonWeaver model , Brookes ' interpretation of Popper 's World 3 , and the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It shows that the term information in these theories refers to empirical entities or events and is conceptualized as having causal powers upon human minds .
Research questions	"It is argued that the epistemological assumptions have led to the negligence of the cultural and social aspects of the constitution of information ( i.e. , how something is considered to be and not to be information ) and the unquestioned nature of science in research methodologies ."
Research questions	"This study looks at users ' dwelling behavior on documents and several contextual factors : the stage of users ' work tasks , task type , and users ' knowledge of task topics , to explore whether or not taking account contextual factors could help infer document usefulness from dwell time ."
Research method	"A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted with 24 participants , each coming 3 times to work on 3 subtasks in a general work task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that task stage could help interpret certain types of dwell time as reliable indicators of document usefulness in certain task types , as was topic knowledge , and the latter played a more significant role when both were available ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study contributes to a better understanding of how dwell time can be used as implicit evidence of document usefulness , as well as how contextual factors can help interpret dwell time as an indicator of usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions have both theoretical and practical implications for using behaviors and contextual factors in the development of personalization systems .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Previous methods are not widely applied in practice because of their high computational complexity and their strong dependency on excessive attributes , such as institutional affiliation , research area , address , etc. , which are difficult to obtain in practice ."
Research method	"To solve this problem , we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for name disambiguation which sequentially employs 3 common and easily accessible attributes ( i.e. , coauthor name , article title , and publication venue ) ."
Research method	"Our proposed framework is based on multiple clustering and consists of 3 steps : ( a ) clustering articles by coauthorship and obtaining rough clusters , that is fragments ; ( b ) clustering fragments obtained in step 1 by title information and getting bigger fragments ; ( c ) and clustering fragments obtained in step 2 by the latent relations among venues ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results on a Digital Bibliography and Library Project ( DBLP ) data set show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by 2.4 % to 22.7 % on the average pairwise F1 score and is 10 to 100 times faster in terms of execution time .
Research method	"In 2009 , 40,000 authors of research papers from across the globe were invited to complete an online survey ."
Research method	"Researchers were asked to rate a number of general statements about peer review , and then a subset of respondents , who had themselves peer reviewed , rated a series of statements concerning their experience of peer review ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study found that the peer review process is highly regarded by the vast majority of researchers and considered by most to be essential to the communication of scholarly research .
Research findings/conclusions	Nine out of 10 authors believe that peer review improved the last paper they published .
Research method	Double-blind peer review is considered the most effective form of peer review .
Research findings/conclusions	Nearly three quarters of researchers think that technological advances are making peer review more effective .
Research questions	"Most researchers believe that although peer review should identify fraud , it is very difficult for it to do so ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Reviewers are committed to conducting peer review in the future and believe that simple practical steps , such as training new reviewers would further improve peer review ."
Research findings/conclusions	Full-text analysis offers the opportunity to significantly improve the quality of the signals upon which these co-citation models are based .
Research questions	In this work we study the effect of reference proximity on the accuracy of co-citation clusters .
Research method	"Using a corpus of 270,521 full text documents from 2007 , we compare the results of traditional co-citation clustering using only the bibliographic information to results from co-citation clustering where proximity between reference pairs is factored into the pairwise relationships ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that accounting for reference proximity from full text can increase the textual coherence ( a measure of accuracy ) of a co-citation cluster solution by up to 30 % over the traditional approach based on bibliographic information .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Here , the writings of J.C. Bose are studied from this perspective ."
Research findings/conclusions	It may be noted that the relation between Bose and Nivedita was personal in nature .
Research method	"Three important style markersfunction words , punctuation marks , and usage of words are used to trace the changes in Bose 's writing style , if any ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that during the association between Bose and Nivedita , Bose 's style of writing changed considerably in comparison to the earlier period when they did not know each other ."
Research findings/conclusions	It shows Nivedita helped Bose in preparing his journal articles and books .
Research findings/conclusions	The results reveal a distinct change in Bose 's writing style after his meeting with Nivedita .
Research findings/conclusions	This is reflected in his changing pattern of usage of these three stylistic features .
Research findings/conclusions	"Bose slowly moved back towards his original style of writing after Nivedita 's death , but his later works still carried Nivedita 's influence ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research proposes that these elicitations will depend on the type of question .
Research questions	"In particular , this research explores the relationship between three constructs : question types , elicitations , and the fee that is paid for the answer ."
Research method	"These relationships are explored for a few different question typologies , including a new kind of question type that we call Identity ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is found that the kinds of clarifications that intermediaries elicit depend on the type of question in systematic ways .
Research findings/conclusions	A practical implication is that interactive question-answering serviceswhether human or automatedcan be steered to focus attention on the kinds of clarification that are evidently most needed for that question type .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , it is found that certain question types , as well as the number of elicitations , are associated with higher fees ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This means that it may be possible to define a pricing structure for question-answering services based on objective and predictable characteristics of the question , which would help to establish a rational market for this type of information service ."
Research findings/conclusions	The newly introduced Identity question type was found to be especially reliable in predicting elicitations and fees .
Research method	Our article describes formative research conducted as part of a larger study focused on the development of an online HIV prevention platform tailored for Black female college students .
Research method	"To inform the design of our platform , we conducted focus groups with 60 Black women enrolled at two predominantly White institutions ( PWIs ) ."
Research questions	"The Research questions of the focus groups was to understand information needs , awareness of specific information resources , and the search strategies employed for finding and evaluating HIV prevention information ."
Research findings/conclusions	We used hypervisibility as a sensitizing lens for making sense of how the intersecting gender and racial identities of Black womanhood shape informationseeking behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"Four themes emerged : platform choice and privacy , relatability , respectability politics , and silence on campus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The themes depict discursive representations specific to Black female identity to manage stigma , reduce their hypervisibility , and amplify their authentic voices in the broader HIV prevention discourse ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions contribute to human information behavior scholarship on marginalized groups .
Research questions	"Hence , it is important to develop an understanding of how it is situated within society and the wider roles it is called onto perform ."
Research questions	This article argues that one of these roles is as a depository of collective memory .
Research method	"Building on the work of Pentzold , I present a case study of the English Wikipedia article on the Vietnam War to demonstrate that the article , or more accurately , its talk pages , provide a forum for the contestation of collective memory ."
Research questions	I further argue that this function is one that should be supported by libraries as they position themselves within a rapidly changing digital world .
Research method	We measured referee behavior and referees ' agreement .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that the disciplinary background and the academic status of the referee have an influence on the report time , the type of recommendation and the acceptance of the reviewing task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Referees from the humanities tend to be more generous in their recommendations than other referees , especially economists and environmental scientists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Second , we found that senior researchers are harsher in their judgments than junior researchers , and the latter accept requests to review more often and are faster in reporting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we found that articles that had been refereed and recommended for publication by a multidisciplinary set of referees were subsequently more likely to receive citations than those that had been reviewed by referees from the same discipline ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results show that common standards of evaluation can be established even in multidisciplinary communities .
Research questions	"Despite its popularity , little is known about the age and discipline of the articles uploaded and viewed in the site and whether publication statistics from the site could be useful impact indicators ."
Research method	"In response , this article assesses samples of ResearchGate articles uploaded at specific dates , comparing their views in the site to their Mendeley readers and Scopus-indexed citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This analysis shows that ResearchGate is dominated by recent articles , which attract about three times as many views as older articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"ResearchGate has uneven coverage of scholarship , with the arts and humanities , health professions , and decision sciences poorly represented and some fields receiving twice as many views per article as others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"View counts for uploaded articles have low to moderate positive correlations with both Scopus citations and Mendeley readers , which is consistent with them tending to reflect a wider audience than Scopus-publishing scholars ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , for articles uploaded to the site , view counts may give a genuinely new audience indicator ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Between them , these standards supply 46 different definitions-a lack of standardization that we might not have expected , given the context ."
Research method	"In fact , if we make creative use of Simpson 's index of concentration ( originally devised as a measure of ecological diversity ) to measure the degree of standardization of definition in this case , we arrive at a value of 0.05 , on a scale of zero to one ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is suggested , however , that the situation is not as problematic as it might seem : that low cross-domain levels of standardization of definition should not be cause for concern ."
Research questions	"The ability to make connections to others is a defining characteristic of the sites , but what types of networks are formed , and what are the implications of the structures ?"
Research method	"This study addressed that question through mixed methods social network analysis , focusing on Academia ."
Research findings/conclusions	"edu , ResearchGate , and Twitter , as three of the main sites used by academics in their professional lives ."
Research findings/conclusions	The structure of academics ' ego-networks on social networking sites differs by platform .
Research findings/conclusions	"Networks on academic sites were smaller and more highly clustered , whereas Twitter networks were larger and more diffuse ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Institutions and research interests define communities on academic sites , compared with research topics and personal interests on Twitter ."
Research findings/conclusions	The network structures reflect differences in how academics conceptualize different sites and have implications in relation to fostering social capital and research impact .
Research method	"This study measures the perception change directly as reflected in citation sentiment , with the attainment of a Nobel Prize in Chemistry or a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine considered the status change ."
Research method	"The article identifies 12,393 citances to 25 Nobel articles in PubMed Central and includes a control article set of 75 articles with 30,851 citances ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show a moderate increase in citation sentiment toward Nobel articles postaward .
Research findings/conclusions	"Dynamically , for Nobel articles there is a steady sentiment increase , and a Nobel Prize seems to co-occur with this trend ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This trend , however , is not evident in the control article set ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While there is such a thing as a French conception of information science , this conception is not totally divorced from the Anglophone one ."
Research questions	"Unbeknownst to researchers from the two geographical and cultural regions , they share similar conceptions of the field and invoke similar theoretical foundations , in particular the socio-constructivist theory ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There is also a convergence of viewpoints on the dual nature of information science , i.e. , the fact that it is torn between two competing paradigmsobjectivist and subjectivist ."
Research findings/conclusions	Technology is another area where a convergence of viewpoints is noticeable : Scholars from both geographic and cultural zones display the same suspicion toward the role of technology and of computer science .
Research findings/conclusions	It would therefore be misleading to uphold the view that Anglophone information science is essentially objectivist and technicist while the French conception is essentially social and rooted in the humanities .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper highlights converging analyses from authors based in both linguistic and geographical regions with the aim to foster a better understanding of the challenges that information science is facing worldwide and to help trace a path to how the global information science community can try to meet them .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Whereas one stream in the literature has focused on the structural responsibilities associated with roles , another has stressed the emergent nature of work ."
Research questions	"To date , these streams have proceeded largely in parallel ."
Research questions	"In seeking to enhance our understanding of the tension between structure and agency in peer-production , we investigated the interplay between structural and emergent roles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our study explored the breadth of structural roles in Wikipedia ( English version ) and their linkage to various forms of activities .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analyses show that despite the latitude in selecting their mode of participation , participants ' structural and emergent roles are tightly coupled ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our discussion highlights that : ( a ) participants often stay close to the production ground floor despite the assignment into structural roles ; and ( b ) there are typical modifications in activity patterns associated with role-assignment , namely : functional specialization , multispecialization , defunctionalization , changes in communication patterns , management of identity , and role definition ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We contribute to theory of coordination and roles , as well as provide some practical implications ."
Research questions	"To this end , we explore network properties such as density , percolation robustness , average and largest node distances , reciprocity , incoming and outgoing degree distributions , and assortative mixing by node degrees ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discover that the journal citation network is a dense , robust , small , and reciprocal world ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , in- and out-degree node distributions display long tails , with few vital journals and many trivial ones , and they are strongly positively correlated ."
Research questions	It does so by exploring the sociotechnical systems that have emerged around both Drupal 's development and its face-to-face communitarian events .
Research value/outlook/limitations	There has been criticism of the simplistic nature of previous research into free software ; this study addresses this by linking studies of CBPP with a qualitative study of Drupal 's organizational processes .
Research questions	"It focuses on the evolution of organizational structures , identifying the intertwined dynamics of formalization and decentralization , resulting in coexisting sociotechnical systems that vary in their degrees of organicity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , the aggregate performance is the average of the performance of individual researchers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper explores the issue of the relative magnitude of variability in performance within departments and between departments .
Research method	"It exploits anonymized data at the individual level from one of the largest research evaluation exercises , the Italian VQR 2004-2010 ( Valutazione della Qualita della Ricerca ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If the variability between departments were much larger than variability within departments , we would see evidence of a process of stratification , or vertical differentiation , arguably driven by competition and researcher mobility ."
Research findings/conclusions	The data show that the opposite pattern is at play .
Research findings/conclusions	It is important for the field to get a better understanding of the quality of this process as an approximation for determining the searcher 's actual intent .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Some studies have investigated the reliability of the query intent annotation process by measuring the interassessor agreement .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , these studies did not measure the validity of the judgments , that is , to what extent the annotations match the searcher 's actual intent ."
Research method	"In this study , we asked both the searchers themselves and external assessors to classify queries using the same intent classification scheme ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that of the seven dimensions in our intent classification scheme , four can reliably be used for query annotation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Of these four , only the annotations on the topic and spatial sensitivity dimension are valid when compared with the searcher 's annotations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The difference between the interassessor agreement and the assessor-searcher agreement was significant on all dimensions , showing that the agreement between external assessors is not a good estimator of the validity of the intent classifications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , we encourage the research community to consider using query intent classifications by the searchers themselves as test data ."
Research method	"Bibliometric indicators of important discoveries have been formulated using an empirical approach , based on the mathematical properties of the high-citation tail of the citation distribution ."
Research method	To investigate the theoretical basis of such formulations this study compares the US/European research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries .
Research method	"The research performance ratio in terms of papers was studied from the citation distributions in the fields of chemistry , physics , and biochemistry and molecular biology ."
Research findings/conclusions	It varied as a function of the citation level .
Research method	"Selecting an appropriate high citation level , the ratios in terms of highly cited papers were compared with the corresponding ratios for Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in Chemistry , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries are reasonably similar , and suggest that the research success of the United States is almost 3 times that of Europe ."
Research findings/conclusions	A similar conclusion was obtained using articles published in Nature and Science .
Research questions	Literature draws attention to the critical success factors ( CSFs ) for implementation of BI systems .
Research method	"Leveraging case studies of seven large organizations and blending them with Yeoh and Koronios 's ( 2010 ) BI CSFs framework , our empirical study gives evidence to support this notion of CSFs and provides better contextual understanding of the CSFs in BI implementation domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	Cross-case analysis suggests that organizational factors play the most crucial role in determining the success of a BI system implementation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Hence , BI stakeholders should prioritize on the organizational dimension ahead of other factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions allow BI stakeholders to holistically understand the CSFs and the associated contextual issues that impact on implementation of BI systems .
Research questions	"They are complex systems , constituted by many different components interacting together , and evaluation is crucial to both tune and improve them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , in the current evaluation methodology , there is still no way to determine how much each component contributes to the overall performances and how the components interact together ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This hampers the possibility of a deep understanding of IR system behavior and , in turn , prevents us from designing ahead which components are best suited to work together for a specific search task ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this paper , we move the evaluation methodology one step forward by overcoming these barriers and beginning to devise an anatomy of IR systems and their internals ."
Research method	"In particular , we propose a methodology based on the General Linear Mixed Model ( GLMM ) and analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to develop statistical models able to isolate system variance and component effects as well as their interaction , by relying on a grid of points ( GoP ) containing all the combinations of the analyzed components ."
Research method	We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of two relevant search tasksnews search and web searchby using standard TREC collections .
Research method	"We analyze the basic set of components typically part of an IR system , namely , stop lists , stemmers , and n-grams , and IR models ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this way , we derive insights about English text retrieval ."
Research method	The Hegelian inquiry system is used here to explain the nature of informing on the Internet as activities of information masters to influence information slaves ' opinions and as activities of information slaves to become well informed .
Research questions	The key assumption of Hegelianism regarding information is that information has no value independent from the interests and worldviews ( theses ) it supports .
Research questions	"As part of the dialectic process of generating syntheses , we propose a role for information science of offering methods to critically evaluate the master 's information , and by this we develop an opinion ( thesis ) independent from the master 's power ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For this we offer multiple methods for information criticism , named triangulation , which may help users to evaluate a master 's evidence ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article presents also a prototype of a Hegelian information triangulator tool for information slaves ( i.e. , nonexperts ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The article concludes with suggestions for further research on informative triangulation .
Research findings/conclusions	Each of us holds different values with different degrees of importance .
Research questions	Existing studies show that values of a person can be identified from their social network usage .
Research questions	"However , the value priority of a person may change over time due to different factors such as time , event , influence , social structure , and technology ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this research , we are the first to investigate whether the change of value priorities can be identified from social network usage ."
Research method	We propose a weighted hybrid time-series-based model to capture the change of values of a social network user .
Research findings/conclusions	We conducted an experimental study with 726 Facebook users and showed that our model accurately captures the value priority changes from the social network usage and achieves significantly higher accuracy than our baseline hidden Markov model-based technique .
Research method	We also validated the change of a user 's value priorities in real life using a questionnaire-based technique .
Research questions	"Although responses on CQA sites are obviously slower than information retrieved by a search engine , one of the most frustrating aspects of CQAs occurs when an asker 's posted question does not receive a reasonable answer or remains unanswered ."
Research findings/conclusions	CQA sites could improve users ' experience by identifying potential answerers and routing appropriate questions to them .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this paper , we predict the potential answerers based on question content and user profiles ."
Research method	Our approach builds user profiles based on past activity .
Research method	"When a new question is posted , the proposed method computes scores between the question and all user profiles to find the potential answerers ."
Research method	We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on two popular CQA sites - Yahoo !
Research method	Answers and Stack Overflow - to show the effectiveness of our algorithm .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that our technique is able to predict a small group of 1000 users from which at least one user will answer the question with a probability higher than 50 % in both CQA sites .
Research findings/conclusions	Further analysis indicates that topic interest and activity level can improve the correctness of our approach .
Research findings/conclusions	The dynamic evolution of the Triple Helix can thus be compared among developed and developing nations in terms of cross-sectional coauthorship relations .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that the Triple Helix interactions among the three subsystems U-I-G become less intensive over time , but unequally for different countries ."
Research questions	We suggest that globalization erodes local Triple Helix relations and thus can be expected to have increased differentiation in national systems since the mid-1990s .
Research findings/conclusions	This effect of globalization is more pronounced in developed countries than in developing ones .
Research method	"In the dynamic analysis , we focus on a more detailed comparison between China and the United States ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , the Chinese Academy of the ( Social ) Sciences is changing increasingly from a public research institute to an academic one , and this has a measurable effect on China 's position in the globalization ."
Research questions	"Although a substantial number of journals have practiced delayed OA since they started publishing e-versions , empirical studies concerning OA have often overlooked this body of literature ."
Research method	"This study provides comprehensive quantitative measurements by identifying delayed OA journals and collecting data concerning their publication volumes , embargo lengths , and citation rates ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Altogether , 492 journals were identified , publishing a combined total of 111,312 articles in 2011 ; 77.8 % of these articles were made OA within 12 months from publication , with 85.4 % becoming available within 24 months ."
Research findings/conclusions	A journal impact factor analysis revealed that delayed OA journals have citation rates on average twice as high as those of closed subscription journals and three times as high as immediate OA journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results demonstrate that delayed OA journals constitute an important segment of the openly available scholarly journal literature , both by their sheer article volume and by including a substantial proportion of highimpact journals ."
Research questions	How do users deal with a steep learning curve over time ?
Research questions	Are there particularly problematic aspects of an analytic process ?
Research method	In this article we investigate these questions through an integrative study of the use of CiteSpacea visual analytic tool for finding trends and patterns in scientific literature .
Research method	"In particular , we analyze millions of interactive events in logs generated by users worldwide over a 14-month period ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The key Research findings/conclusions are : ( i ) three levels of proficiency are identified , namely , level 1 : low proficiency , level 2 : intermediate proficiency , and level 3 : high proficiency , and ( ii ) behavioral patterns at level 3 are resulted from a more engaging interaction with the system , involving a wider variety of events and being characterized by longer state transition paths , whereas behavioral patterns at levels 1 and 2 seem to focus on learning how to use the tool ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study contributes to the development and evaluation of visual analytic systems in realistic settings and provides a valuable addition to the study of interactive visual analytic processes .
Research questions	"Yet , the true nature of citations and their proper interpretation have been the center of a long , but still unresolved discussion in Bibliometrics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A comparison of 67,578 pairs of studies on the same healthcare topic , with the same publication age ( 1-15 years ) reveals that when one of the studies is being selected for citation , it has on average received about three times as many citations as the other study ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the average citation-gap between selected or deselected studies narrows slightly over time , which fits poorly with the name-dropping interpretation and better with the quality and impact-interpretation ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results demonstrate that authors in the field of Healthcare tend to cite highly cited documents when they have a choice .
Research findings/conclusions	This is more likely caused by differences related to quality than differences related to status of the publications cited .
Research questions	"Following Husserl 's idea of a horizon of meanings in intersubjective communication , we propose a way in which , using Shannon 's equations , the generation and selection of meanings from a horizon of possibilities can be considered probabilistically ."
Research questions	"The information-theoretical dynamics we articulate considers a process of meaning generation within cultural evolution : information is imbued with meaning , and through this process , the number of options for the selection of meaning in discourse proliferates ."
Research findings/conclusions	The redundancy of possible meanings contributes to a codification of expectations within the discourse .
Research findings/conclusions	"Unlike hardwired DNA , the codes of nonbiological systems can coevolve with the variations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Spanning horizons of meaning , the codes structure the communications as selection environments that shape discourses ."
Research questions	Discursive knowledge can be considered as meta-coded communication that enables us to translate among differently coded communications .
Research findings/conclusions	"The dynamics of discursive knowledge production can thus infuse the historical dynamics with a cultural evolution by adding options , that is , by increasing redundancy ."
Research findings/conclusions	A calculus of redundancy is presented as an indicator whereby these dynamics of discourse and meaning may be explored empirically .
Research findings/conclusions	Effective and efficient medical image retrieval systems are required to better manage medical image information .
Research findings/conclusions	Text-based image retrieval ( TBIR ) was very successful in retrieving images with textual descriptions .
Research questions	"Several TBIR approaches rely on models based on bag-of-words approaches , in which the image retrieval problem turns into one of standard text-based information retrieval : where the meanings and values of specific medical entities in the text and metadata are ignored in the image representation and retrieval process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , we believe that TBIR should extract specific medical entities and terms and then exploit these elements to achieve better image retrieval results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Therefore , we propose a novel reranking method based on medical-image-dependent features ."
Research method	These features are manually selected by a medical expert from imaging modalities and medical terminology .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we represent queries and images using only medical-image-dependent features such as image modality and image scale ."
Research method	"Second , we exploit the defined features in a new reran king method for medical image retrieval ."
Research questions	Our motivation is the large influence of image modality in medical image retrieval and its impact on image-relevance scores .
Research method	"To evaluate our approach , we performed a series of experiments on the medical ImageCLEF data sets from 2009 to 2013 ."
Research method	"The BM25 model , a language model , and an image-relevance feedback model are used as baselines to evaluate our approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results show that compared to the BM25 model , the proposed model significantly enhances image retrieval performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also compared our approach with other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our approach performs comparably to those of the top three runs in the official ImageCLEF competition .
Research findings/conclusions	"Given the importance of interdisciplinary research , it is essential to be aware of disciplinary differences in aspects of scholarship , such as the significance of recent changes in a field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This paper identifies potential changes in 25 subject categories through a term comparison of words in article titles , keywords and abstracts in 1 year compared to the previous 4 years ."
Research method	The scholarly influence of new research issues is indirectly assessed with a citation analysis of articles matching each trending term .
Research findings/conclusions	"While topic-related words dominate the top terms , style , national focus , and language changes are also evident ."
Research questions	"Thus , as reflected in Scopus , fields evolve along multiple dimensions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , while articles exploiting new issues are usually more cited in some fields , such as Organic Chemistry , they are usually less cited in others , including History ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The possible causes of new issues being less cited include externally driven temporary factors , such as disease outbreaks , and internally driven temporary decisions , such as a deliberate emphasis on a single topic ( e.g. , through a journal special issue ) ."
Research questions	"With print publications , the responsibility rested primarily with librarians , but the shift toward digital publishing and , in particular , the introduction of open access ( OA ) have caused ambiguity and complexity ."
Research questions	"Consequently , the long-term accessibility of journals is not always guaranteed , and they can even disappear from the web completely ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The focus of this exploratory study is on the phenomenon of vanished journals , something that has not been carried out before ."
Research method	"For the analysis , we consulted several major bibliographic indexes , such as Scopus , Ulrichsweb , and the Directory of Open Access Journals , and traced the journals through the Internet Archive 's Wayback Machine ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found 174 OA journals that , through lack of comprehensive and open archives , vanished from the web between 2000 and 2019 , spanning all major research disciplines and geographic regions of the world ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results raise vital concern for the integrity of the scholarly record and highlight the urgency to take collaborative action to ensure continued access and prevent the loss of more scholarly knowledge .
Research findings/conclusions	We encourage those interested in the phenomenon of vanished journals to use the public dataset for their own research .
Research method	"In this article a theoretical model , encompassing both normative and constructivist approaches , is suggested ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The conceptualization of scientific communities as autopoietic systems , the components of which are communicative events , allows us to observe the reproductive function of citations conceived as codes and media of scientific communication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Citations , thanks to their constraining and enabling properties , constitute the engine of the structuration process ensuring the reproduction of scientific communities ."
Research method	"By referring to Giddens ' structuration theory , Luhmann 's theory about social systems as communicative networks , Merton 's sociology of science and his conceptualizations about the functions of citations , as well as Small 's proposal about citations as concept-symbols , a sociologically integrated approach to scientometrics is proposed ."
Research method	This includes an investigation into their knowledge about and perceived characteristics of this evolving research tool .
Research method	The study relied on Rogers 's model of the innovation-decision process to guide the development of an interview guide .
Research method	Ten semistructured interviews were conducted with history faculty between October 2010 and December 2011 .
Research method	A grounded theory approach was employed to code and analyze the data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions about tradition , cost , teaching innovations , and the historical research process provide the background for designing learning opportunities for the professional development of historians and the academic librarians who work with them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While historians are open to experimenting with e-books , they are also concerned about the loss of serendipity in digital environments , the lack of availability of key resources , and the need for technological transparency ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions show that Rogers 's knowledge and persuasion stages are cyclical in nature , with scholars moving back and forth between these two stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	Participants interviewed were already weighing the five characteristics of the persuasion stage without having much knowledge about e-books .
Research findings/conclusions	The study Research findings/conclusions have implications for our understanding of the diffusion of innovations in academia : both print and digital collections are being used in parallel without one replacing the other .
Research questions	"Despite their popularity , it is unclear whether the use of social media for ELIS heightens problematic outcomes , such as encountering too much information and finding irrelevant , conflicting , outdated , and noncredible information ."
Research method	"In light of this gap , this study tested ( a ) whether the level of problematic informational outcomes varies with the use of social networking sites , microblogs , and social question and answer sites ; ( b ) whether the problem level varies by gender and problem-solving styles ; and ( c ) whether the aforementioned factors have significant interaction effects ."
Research method	An online questionnaire was used to survey 791 U.S. undergraduates .
Research findings/conclusions	Irrelevant information was the top issue .
Research findings/conclusions	"Gender difference was statistically significant for conflicting information , which was more problematic for women ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The multiway analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) indicated notable problem-solving style differences , especially on the Personal Control subscale ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This highlights the importance of affective factors .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is noteworthy that although social media use has no significant main effect , there were significant interaction effects between microblog use and the Approach-Avoidance and Problem Solving Confidence subscales ."
Research findings/conclusions	The impact of microblog use on ELIS outcomes therefore warrants further investigation .
Research method	Five propositions are posited for further testing .
Research method	"By drawing from the structural , relational , and cognitive elements of social capital theory to inform antecedents to information quality and source accessibility , a research model is developed and tested ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For interpersonal information sources , information quality is the key determinant of source use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Perceptions of information quality and accessibility of an interpersonal source are shown to be influenced by boundary spanning , transactive memory , and content type ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications and prescriptions for future research are discussed .
Research questions	"The goal of this article is to examine , among all the available online sources , which online sources laypeople select to address their health-related information needs , and whether or how much the severity of a health condition influences their selection ."
Research method	"Twenty-four participants were recruited individually , and each was asked ( using a retrieval system called HIS ) to search for information regarding a severe health condition and a mild health condition , respectively ."
Research method	The selected online health information sources were automatically captured by the HIS system and classified at both the website and webpage levels .
Research method	Participants ' selection behavior patterns were then plotted across the whole information-seeking process .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results demonstrate that laypeople 's source selection fluctuates during the health information-seeking process , and also varies by the severity of health conditions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study reveals laypeople 's real usage of different types of online health information sources , and engenders implications to the design of search engines , as well as the development of health literacy programs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	How to label the classes in these classifications is a problem that has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature .
Research method	"In this study , we evaluate different approaches to label the classes in algorithmically constructed classifications of research publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	We focus on two important choices : the choice of ( a ) different bibliographic fields and ( b ) different approaches to weight the relevance of terms .
Research method	"To evaluate the different choices , we created two baselines : one based on the Medical Subject Headings in MEDLINE and another based on the Science-Metrix journal classification ."
Research method	We tested to what extent different approaches yield the desired labels for the classes in the two baselines .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on our results , we recommend extracting terms from titles and keywords to label classes at high levels of granularity ( e.g. , topics ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At low levels of granularity ( e.g. , disciplines ) we recommend extracting terms from journal names and author addresses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We recommend the use of a new approach , term frequency to specificity ratio , to calculate the relevance of terms ."
Research questions	A major shortcoming of current automated plagiarism detection approaches is their dependence on high character-based similarity .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , heavily disguised plagiarism forms , such as paraphrases , translated plagiarism , or structural and idea plagiarism , remain undetected ."
Research questions	"A recently proposed language-independent approach to plagiarism detection , Citation-based Plagiarism Detection ( CbPD ) , allows the detection of semantic similarity even in the absence of text overlap by analyzing the citation placement in a document 's full text to determine similarity ."
Research method	"This article evaluates the performance of CbPD in detecting plagiarism with various degrees of disguise in a collection of 185,000 biomedical articles ."
Research method	We benchmark CbPD against two character-based detection approaches using a ground truth approximated in a user study .
Research findings/conclusions	Our evaluation shows that the citation-based approach achieves superior ranking performance for heavily disguised plagiarism forms .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , we demonstrate CbPD to be computationally more efficient than character-based approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , upon combining the citation-based with the traditional character-based document similarity visualization methods in a hybrid detection prototype , we observe a reduction in the required user effort for document verification ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although there are various conceptualizations of the IField , to date , in-depth studies based on empirical evidence are scarce ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article reports a study that fills this gap .
Research method	We focus on the first five ISchools in the ICaucus as a proxy to represent the IField .
Research method	The intellectual characteristics are depicted by two independent sets of data on tenure track faculty as knowledge contributors : their intellectual heritages and the intellectual substance in their journal publications .
Research method	We use a critical analysis method to examine doctoral training areas and 3 years of journal publications .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results indicate that ( a ) the IField can be better conceptualized with empirical support by a four-component model that includes People , Information , Technology , and Management , as predicted by the I-Model ( Zhang & Benjamin , 2007 ) ; ( b ) the ISchools ' faculty members are diverse , interdisciplinary , and multidisciplinary as shown by their intellectual heritages , by their research foci , by journals in which they publish , by the contexts within which they conduct research , and by the levels of analysis in research investigations ; ( c ) the five ISchools share similarities while evincing differences in both faculty heritages and intellectual substances ; ( d ) ISchool tenure track faculty members do not collaborate much with each other within or across schools although there is great potential ; and ( e ) intellectual heritages are not good predictors of scholars ' intellectual substance ."
Research questions	"We conclude by discussing the implications of the Research findings/conclusions on IField identity , IField development , new ISchool formation and existing ISchool evolution , faculty career development , and collaboration within the IField ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"On one side , the user-centered paradigm asks researchers to focus on the individual ; on the other , emerging context-centered approaches move the position of context into the foreground of information studies ."
Research questions	"Although there have been attempts to create in between approaches to achieve a compromise between these two positions , they have merely generated more positions between the two poles in a continuum between approaches focusing on the individual and those focusing on context ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Such positioning not only creates an endless debate about the research focus of information studies but also limits such studies to a set of factors , a priori defined by the researcher ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This article argues that IB research could benefit from actor-network theory , which could give the actors a space to perform their own positioning ."
Research findings/conclusions	CCSAV tools require users to contribute to the creation of a joint artifact ( argument map ) instead of contributing to a conversation .
Research questions	In this paper we assess empirically the effects of this fundamental design choice and show that the absence of conversational affordances and socially salient information in representation-centric tools is detrimental to the users ' collaboration experience .
Research method	"We report empirical Research findings/conclusions from a study in which subjects using different collaborative platforms ( a forum , an argumentation platform , and a socially augmented argumentation tool ) were asked to discuss and predict the price of a commodity ."
Research findings/conclusions	By comparing users ' experience across several metrics we found evidence that the collaborative performance decreases gradually when we remove conversational interaction and other types of socially salient information .
Research findings/conclusions	We interpret these Research findings/conclusions through theories developed in conversational analysis ( common ground theory ) and communities of practice and discuss design implications .
Research questions	"In particular , we propose balancing the trade-off between knowledge reification and participation in representation-centric tools with the provision of social feedback and functionalities supporting meaning negotiation ."
Research questions	"However , with the rapid development of network technologies such as cloud computing , the server-side of a digital library is becoming more and more untrusted ; thus , how to prevent the disclosure of users ' book query privacy is causing people 's increasingly extensive concern ."
Research method	"In this article , we propose to construct a group of plausible fake queries for each user book query to cover up the sensitive subjects behind users ' queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we propose a basic framework for the privacy protection in book search , which requires no change to the book search algorithm running on the server-side , and no compromise to the accuracy of book search ."
Research method	"Second , we present a privacy protection model for book search to formulate the constraints that ideal fake queries should satisfy , that is , ( i ) the feature similarity , which measures the confusion effect of fake queries on users ' queries , and ( ii ) the privacy exposure , which measures the cover-up effect of fake queries on users ' sensitive subjects ."
Research method	"Third , we discuss the algorithm implementation for the privacy model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation ."
Research method	"For fine-grained analysis , census agencies publish census microdata that consist of a sample of individual records of the census containing detailed anonymous individual information ."
Research questions	Working with microdata from different censuses and doing comparative studies are currently difficult tasks due to the diversity of formats and granularities .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we show that novel data processing techniques can be applied to make census microdata interoperable and easy to access and combine ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In fact , we demonstrate how Linked Open Data principles , a set of techniques to publish and make connections of ( semi- ) structured data on the web , can be fruitfully applied to census microdata ."
Research method	"We present a step-by-step process to achieve this goal and we study , in theory and practice , two real case studies : the 2001 Spanish census and a general framework for Integrated Public Use Microdata Series ( IPUMS-I ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Five categories are identified : use of loose analogies and metaphors between concepts in quantum physics and library/information science ; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in information retrieval ; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in studying meaning and concepts ; quantum social science , in areas adjacent to information science ; and the qualitative application of quantum concepts in the information disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Quantum issues have led to demonstrable progress in information retrieval and semantic modelling , with less clear-cut progress elsewhere ."
Research questions	"Whether there may be a future quantum turn in the information sciences is debated , the implications of such a turn are considered , and a research agenda outlined ."
Research method	"Tag is represented inked red or green according to users ' personal experiences and judgments about purchased items : red for positive comments , green for negative ones ."
Research questions	The valence of users ' emotion induced by red or green is controversial .
Research method	"This study firstly discovers that colored tags inked in red incite users ' positive emotion ( evaluations ) and colored tags inked in green incite negative emotion ( evaluations ) using an ERP experiment , which is manifested in ERP components ( e.g. , N170 , N2c , and LPC ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	There are two main features of Tag : the text of Tag ( abbr .
Research method	Text ) and the color of Tag ( abbr.Color ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our study then proves that Color ( red or green ) is the dominant factor in users ' decision behavior compared with Text under the high cognitive load condition , while users ' decision behavior is influenced by Text ( positive tags or negative tags ) predominately rather than by Color under the low cognitive load condition with the help of Eye tracking instrument ."
Research findings/conclusions	Those Research findings/conclusions can help to design colored tags for recommendation systems on e-commerce websites and other online platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	"For generators , stature can influence attractiveness of alternative dissemination routes and deliberations of those who assess generator performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For knowledge consumers , channel stature may influence knowledge content to which they are exposed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study introduces a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring stature of knowledge-dissemination channels : the power-impact ( PI ) technique .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is a flexible technique having 3 complementary variants , giving holistic insights about channel stature by accounting for both attraction of knowledge generators to a distribution channel and degree to which knowledge consumers choose to use a channel 's knowledge content ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Each PI variant is expressed in terms of multiple parameters , permitting customization of stature evaluation to suit its user 's preferences ."
Research method	"In the spirit of analytics , each PI variant is driven by objective evidence of actual behaviors ."
Research method	"The PI technique is based on 2 building blocks : ( a ) power that channels have for attracting results of generators ' knowledge work , and ( b ) impact that channel contents ' exhibit on prospective recipients ."
Research findings/conclusions	Feasibility and functionality of the PI-technique design are demonstrated by applying it to solve a problem of journal stature evaluation for the information-systems discipline .
Research findings/conclusions	These two indicators raised doubts about the reliability of this ranking method because they are difficult to cope with .
Research findings/conclusions	"Recently , a newsletter was published featuring a reduced ARWU ranking list , leaving out Nobel Prize and Fields Medal indicators : the Alternative Ranking ( Excluding Award Factor ) ."
Research method	We used uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to examine and compare the stability and confidence of the official ARWU ranking and the Alternative Ranking .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that if the ARWU ranking is reduced to the 4-indicator Alternative Ranking , it shows greater certainty and stability in ranking universities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"HIB has not been examined in detail at the broader contextual level of intellectual Research questions ( that is , the higher-order conceptual tasks the information was acquired to support ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Examination at this level can enhance holistic understanding of HIB as a means to an intellectual end and inform the design of digital information environments that support information interaction for specific intellectual Research questionss .
Research method	"We investigate information-based ideation ( IBI ) as a specific intellectual information acquisition and use context by conducting Critical Incident-style interviews with 10 game designers , focusing on how they interact with information to generate and develop creative design ideas ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions give rise to a framework of their ideation-focused HIB , which systems designers can leverage to reason about how best to support certain behaviors to drive design ideation ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions emphasize the importance of intellectual Research questions as a driver for acquisition and desired outcome of use .
Research questions	"This article reviews current efforts to connect music data through the Semantic Web , with an emphasis on the Music Ontology ( MO ) and ontology alignment approaches ; it also presents a framework for understanding the life cycle of a musical work , focusing on the central activities of composition , performance , and use ."
Research method	"The project studied metadata structures and properties of 11 music-related LD data sets and mapped them to the descriptions commonly used in the library cataloging records for sound recordings and musical scores ( including MARC records and their extended schema.org markup ) , and records from 20 collections of digitized music recordings and scores ( featuring a variety of metadata structures ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis resulted in a set of crosswalks and a unified crosswalk that aligns these properties .
Research method	The paper reports on detailed methodologies used and discusses research Research findings/conclusions and issues .
Research findings/conclusions	"Topics of particular concern include ( a ) the challenges of mapping between the overgeneralized descriptions found in library data and the specialized , music-oriented properties present in the LD data sets ; ( b ) the hidden information and access points in library data ; and ( c ) the potential benefits of enriching library data through the mapping of properties found in library catalogs to similar properties used by LD data sets ."
Research method	They rely on a large number of features to compute the rank of search results for each given query .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The estimated reputation of pages is among the effective features available for search engine designers , probably being adopted by most current commercial search engines ."
Research method	Page reputation is estimated by analyzing the linkage relationships between pages .
Research method	"This information is used by link analysis algorithms as a query-independent feature , to be taken into account when computing the rank of the results ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Unfortunately , several types of links found on the web may damage the estimated page reputation and thus cause a negative effect on the quality of search results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work studies alternatives to reduce the negative impact of such noisy links .
Research questions	"More specifically , the authors propose and evaluate new methods that deal with noisy links , considering scenarios where the reputation of pages is computed using the PageRank algorithm ."
Research findings/conclusions	"They show , through experiments with real web content , that their methods achieve significant improvements when compared to previous solutions proposed in the literature ."
Research method	"Answers , a major question and answer ( Q & A ) site ."
Research method	"Mainly drawing on the ideas of Toulmin ( ) , argument pattern is conceptualized as a set of 5 major elements : claim , counterclaim , rebuttal , support , and grounds ."
Research findings/conclusions	The combinations of these elements result in diverse argument patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	"Failed opening consists of an initial claim only , whereas nonoppositional argument pattern also includes indications of support ."
Research method	Oppositional argument pattern contains the elements of counterclaim and rebuttal .
Research method	Mixed argument pattern entails all 5 elements .
Research method	The empirical data were gathered by downloading from Yahoo !
Research questions	Answers 100 discussion threads discussing global warminga controversial topic providing a fertile ground for arguments for and against .
Research findings/conclusions	"Of the argument patterns , failed openings were most frequent , followed by oppositional , nonoppositional , and mixed patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In most cases , the participants grounded their arguments by drawing on personal beliefs and facts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest that oppositional and mixed argument patterns provide more opportunities for the assessment of the quality and credibility of answers , as compared to failed openings and nonoppositional argument patterns ."
Research questions	"For this study , the term social technologies refers to the fast-evolving suite of tools such as traditional applications like e-mail , phone , and instant messenger ; emerging social networking platforms ( often known as social media ) such as blogs and wikis ; public social networking sites ( i.e. , Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn ) ; and enterprise social networking technologies that are specifically hosted within one organization 's computing environment ( i.e. , Socialtext ) ."
Research method	"Building from structuration theory , the analysis presented focuses on the knowledge practices of consultants related to their uses of social technologies and the ways in which organizational norms and policies influence these practices ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	A primary contribution of this research is a detailed contextualization of social technology uses by knowledge workers .
Research questions	"As many organizations are allowing social media-enabled knowledge sharing to develop organically , most corporate policy toward these platforms remains defensive , not strategic , limiting opportunities ."
Research findings/conclusions	Implications for uses and expectations of social technologies arising from this research will help organizations craft relevant policies and rules to best support technology-enabled informal knowledge practices .
Research method	"Using archival and publication data , we examine pairwise research collaborations among 1,138 faculty members over a 12-year period at a medical school in the United States ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Modeling at the dyadic level , we find that faculty members with more shared institutional affiliations are positively associated with knowledge creation and knowledge impact , and that this association is moderated by the physical proximity of collaborators ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We further find that the positive influence of disciplinary diversity ( e.g. , collaborators from different fields ) on knowledge impact is stronger among pairs that share more affiliations and is significantly reduced as the physical distance among collaborators increases ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These results support the idea that shared institutional affiliations and physical proximity can increase interpersonal contact , providing more opportunities to develop trust and mutual understanding , and thus alleviating some of the coordination issues that can arise with higher disciplinary diversity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We discuss the implications for future research on scientific collaborations , managerial practice regarding office space allocation , and strategic planning of initiatives aimed at promoting interdisciplinary collaboration ."
Research questions	"Some choices and process events are captured automatically , but their interactions are not currently well understood or documented ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study examined the decision space of web archives and its role in shaping what is and what is not captured in the web archiving process .
Research questions	"By comparing how three different web archives collections were created and documented , we investigate how curatorial decisions interact with technical and external factors and we compare commonalities and differences ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions reveal the need to understand both the social and technical context that shapes those decisions and the ways in which these individual decisions interact .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the study , we propose a framework for documenting key dimensions of a collection that addresses the situated nature of the organizational context , technical specificities , and unique characteristics of web materials that are the focus of a collection ."
Research findings/conclusions	The framework enables future researchers to undertake empirical work studying the process of creating web archives collections in different contexts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Despite a plethora of research Research findings/conclusions suggesting that a significant group of users look for information within a specific geographical scope , existing reformulation studies lack a focused analysis of how users reformulate geographic queries ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study comprehensively investigates the ways in which users reformulate such needs in an attempt to fill this gap in the literature .
Research method	"Reformulated sessions were sampled from a query log of a major search engine to extract 2,400 entries that were manually inspected to filter geo sessions ."
Research method	"This filter identified 471 search sessions that included geographical intent , and these sessions were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results revealed that one in five of the users who reformulated their queries were looking for geographically related information .
Research method	They reformulated their queries by changing the content of the query rather than the structure .
Research findings/conclusions	Users were not following a unified sequence of modifications and instead performed a single reformulation action .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , in some cases it was possible to anticipate their next move ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A number of tasks in geo modifications were identified , including standard , multi-needs , multi-places , and hybrid approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The research concludes that it is important to specialize query reformulation studies to focus on particular query types rather than generically analyzing them , as it is apparent that geographic queries have their special reformulation characteristics ."
Research method	"Based on a survey of members of the condensed matter physics ( CMP ) community gathered around the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory , a large national laboratory , this article defines a model of CMP research project tasks consisting of 10 task constructs ."
Research method	"In addition , the study develops a model of data quality perceptions by CMP scientists consisting of four data quality constructs ."
Research questions	"The paper also discusses relationships among the data quality perceptions , project roles , and demographic characteristics of CMP scientists ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of the study can inform the design of a CMP data curation model that is aligned and harmonized with the community 's research work structure and data practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"OA publishing is now actively stimulated by Dutch science policy , similar to the United Kingdom ."
Research method	"We conducted a bibliometric baseline measurement to assess the current situation , to be able to measure developments over time ."
Research method	"We collected data from various sources , and for three different smaller European countries ( the Netherlands , Denmark , and Switzerland ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	Not all of the analyses for this baseline measurement are included here .
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis presented in this article focuses on the various ways OA can be defined using the Web of Science , limiting the analysis mainly to Gold OA ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From the data we collected we can conclude that the way OA is currently registered in various electronic bibliographic databases is quite unclear , and various methods applied deliver results that are different , although the impact scores derived from the data point in the same direction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on publicly available archival data from 178 countries , our results provide support for the hypothesized model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , whereas political stability , government effectiveness , and rule of law moderated the relationship of information infrastructure with e-government development in a positive direction , voice and accountability and control of corruption moderated the relationship negatively ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , the relationship between information infrastructure and e-government development was not contingent on regulatory quality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions contribute to the theoretical discourse on e-government development by highlighting the complementary role of governance and provide suggestions for practice in managing e-government development by enhancing governance , thereby leveraging the effect of information infrastructure on e-government development ."
Research method	"The 2D distribution of these institutions is then utilized ( 1 ) to categorize the institutions into a number of qualitative groups revealing the nature of their performance , and ( 2 ) to determine the position of a specific institution among the set of institutions ."
Research method	The method is compared with some major h-type indices and tested with empirical data using clinical medicine as an illustrative case .
Research findings/conclusions	"The method is extensible to the research performance evaluation at other aggregation levels such as researchers , journals , departments , and nations ."
Research method	"To address this , I analyze data from a social networking site that started charging its users for an app that populates their e-mail address books with updated contact information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"I find that purchase rates of the app were higher for users with large , structurally diverse networks - which contain several distinct social groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , personal ties ( i.e. , family members and friends ) increased purchase rates more than professional ties ."
Research findings/conclusions	"I attribute the first effect to the difficulty of obtaining information about a large , diverse social network , which the app reduces , and the second effect to the regularity with which people use information about their personal ties ."
Research questions	"In this article , we present a framework to classify these web robots from two orthogonal perspectives , namely , their functionality and the types of resources they consume ."
Research method	"Applying the classification framework to a year-long access log from the UConn SoE web server , we present trends that point to significant differences in their crawling behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For scientists to leverage the value of existing government data sets , critical data sets must be identified and made as widely available as possible ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , government data sets can only be leveraged when policy makers first assess the value of data , in much the same way they decide the value of grants for research outside government ."
Research findings/conclusions	We argue that legislators should also remove structural barriers to interoperability by funding technical infrastructure according to issue clusters rather than administrative programs .
Research findings/conclusions	"As developers attempt to make government data more accessible through portals , they should consider a range of other nontechnical constraints attached to the data ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that agencies react to the large number of constraints by mostly posting their data on their own websites only rather than in data portals that can facilitate sharing .
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the nontechnical constraints , we find that scientists working in government agencies exercise some autonomy in data decisions , such as data documentation , which determine whether or not the data can be widely shared ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Fortunately , scientists indicate a willingness to share the data they collect or maintain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , we argue further that a complete measure of access should also consider the normative decisions to collect ( or not ) particular data ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This work quantifies how much of the technologically-mediated information and communication explosion during the period of digitization ( 1986-2007 ) was driven by the deployment of additional technological devices , and how much by technological progress in hardware and software ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that technological progress has contributed between two to six times more than additional technological infrastructure .
Research findings/conclusions	"While infrastructure seems to reach a certain level of saturation at roughly 20 storage devices per capita and 2 to 3 telecommunication subscriptions per capita , informational capacities are still expanding greatly ."
Research questions	"Besides progress in better hardware , software for information compression turns out to be an important and often neglected driver of the global growth of technologically-mediated information and communication capacities ."
Research questions	With the increased generative capacity of corpus-based conversational agents comes the need to classify and filter out malevolent responses that are inappropriate in terms of content and dialogue acts .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous studies on the topic of detecting and classifying inappropriate content are mostly focused on a specific category of malevolence or on single sentences instead of an entire dialogue .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We make three contributions to advance research on the malevolent dialogue response detection and classification ( MDRDC ) task .
Research method	"First , we define the task and present a hierarchical malevolent dialogue taxonomy ."
Research method	"Second , we create a labeled multiturn dialogue data set and formulate the MDRDC task as a hierarchical classification task ."
Research method	"Last , we apply state-of-the-art text classification methods to the MDRDC task , and report on experiments aimed at assessing the performance of these approaches ."
Research questions	Behavioral intention ( BI ) to use an IT is considered the sole proximal determinant of IT adoption and use .
Research questions	"Recently , researchers have discussed the limitations of BI and argued that behavioral expectation ( BE ) would be a better predictor of IT use ."
Research questions	"However , without a theoretical and empirical understanding of the determinants of BE , we remain limited in our comprehension of what factors promote greater IT use in organizations ."
Research method	"Using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as the theoretical framework , we develop a model that posits 2 determinants ( i.e. , social influence and facilitating conditions ) of BE and 4 moderators ( i.e. , gender , age , experience , and voluntariness of use ) of the relationship between BE and its determinants ."
Research questions	We argue that the cognitions underlying the formation of BI and BE differ .
Research findings/conclusions	We found strong support for the proposed model in a longitudinal field study of 321 users of a new IT .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We offer theoretical and practical IT implications of our Research findings/conclusions .
Research method	"The paper sets out to correct this through an analysis of the logs of a major cultural website , Europeana ."
Research method	"The behavior of nearly 70,000 mobile users was examined over a period of more than a year and compared with that for PC users of the same site and for the same period ."
Research method	"The analyses conducted include : size and growth of use , time patterns of use ; geographical location of users , digital collections used ; comparative information-seeking behavior using dashboard metrics , clustering of users according to their information seeking , and user satisfaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main Research findings/conclusions were that mobile users were the fastest-growing group and will rise rapidly to a million by December 2012 and that their visits were very different in the aggregate from those arising from fixed platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	"Mobile visits could be described as being information lite : typically shorter , less interactive , and less content viewed per visit ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Use took a social rather than office pattern , with mobile use peaking at nights and weekends ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The variation between different mobile devices was large , with information seeking on the iPad similar to that for PCs and laptops and that for smartphones very different indeed ."
Research findings/conclusions	The research further confirms that informationseeking behavior is platform-specific and the latest platforms are changing it all again .
Research findings/conclusions	Websites will have to adapt .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A variety of studies conducted in organizational settings have provided us with key insights about the collaborative aspects of seeking , retrieving , and using information ."
Research questions	"Researchers have used a range of terms , including collaborative information seeking ( CIS ) , collaborative information retrieval ( CIR ) , collaborative search , collaborative sensemaking , and others to describe various pertinent activities ."
Research questions	"Consequently , we lack conceptual clarity concerning these activities , leading to a tendency to use terms interchangeably when in fact they may be referring to different issues ."
Research questions	"Here , we offer collaborative information behavior ( CIB ) as an umbrella term to connote the collaborative aspects of information seeking , retrieval , and use ."
Research method	We provide the contours of a model of CIB synthesized from Research findings/conclusions of past studies conducted by our research team as well as other researchers .
Research method	"By reanalyzing and synthesizing the data from those studies , we conceptualize CIB as comprised of a set of constitutive activities , organized into three broad phasesproblem formulation , collaborative information seeking , and information use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Some of the activities are specific to a particular phase , whereas others are common to all phases ."
Research questions	We explain how those constitutive activities are related to one another .
Research questions	"Finally , we discuss the limitations of our model as well as its potential usefulness in advancing CIB research ."
Research method	"Such articles were defined as sleeping beauties by van Raan , who quantitatively studied the phenomenon of delayed recognition ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the criteria adopted by van Raan at times are not applicable and may confer recognition prematurely ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To revise such deficiencies , this paper proposes two new criteria , which are applicable ( but not limited ) to exponential citation curves ."
Research method	"We searched for genius work among articles of Nobel Prize laureates during the period of 1901-2012 on the Web of Science , finding 25 articles of genius work out of 21,438 papers including 10 ( by van Raan 's criteria ) sleeping beauties and 15 nonsleeping-beauties ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By our new criteria , two Research findings/conclusions were obtained through empirical analysis : ( a ) the awakening periods for genius work depend on the increase rate b in the exponential function , and ( b ) lower b leads to a longer sleeping period ."
Research questions	"Knowledge embodiment in robotic systems with artificial intelligence ( Al robotic systems ) actualizes the value of knowledge much more powerfully than other entities , potentially altering the connections among people or even displacing professionals ."
Research questions	"To understand the effects of knowledge embodiment in Al robotic systems on connections among people and technology , this study addresses 2 cumulative research questions : ( i ) What is the nature of knowledge embodiment , that is , how are knowledge and Al robots assembled for knowledge work ?"
Research questions	"( ii ) How does knowledge embodiment affect connections among people and technology ( that is , social informatics ) ?"
Research findings/conclusions	"A case study of a large hospital that has employed different Al robotic systems in many parts of its healthcare service provision process indicates 4 forms of knowledge embodiment , each with a distinct focus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , a social informatics analysis suggests four ways knowledge embodiment affects connections among people and technology and reveals related social and institutional issues that go beyond technological determinism ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications of these Research findings/conclusions for research on social informatics and information science are discussed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study synthesizes research throughout different , yet complementary , areas , each capable of contributing Research findings/conclusions and understanding to visual information seeking ."
Research method	"Methods previously applied for examining the visual information seeking process are reviewed , including interactive experiments , surveys , and various qualitative approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The methods and resulting Research findings/conclusions are presented and structured according to generalized phases of existing information seeking models , which include the needs , actions , and assessments of users ."
Research method	"A review of visual information needs focuses on need and thus query formulation ; user actions , as reviewed , centers on search and browse behaviors and the observed trends , concluded by a survey of users ' assessments of visual information as part of the interactive process ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This separate examination , specific to a visual context , is significant ; visual information can influence outcomes in an interactive process and presents variations in the types of needs , tasks , considerations , and decisions of users , as compared to information seeking in other contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Electronic data in the form of semantic predications have a potential role in literature-based discovery , which can be guided by serendipitous knowledge discovery research Research findings/conclusions ."
Research questions	We sought to model information-seeking behavior within the context of serendipitous knowledge discovery by leveraging existing research .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These efforts were done with an eye for a potential literature-based discovery application that utilizes semantic predications .
Research method	"We performed a literature search , reviewed the results , and applied the Research findings/conclusions in developing a model for serendipitous knowledge discovery as an information-seeking behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The literature review indicated four important themes in serendipitous knowledge discovery : iteration , change or clarification , a seeker 's prior knowledge , and the role of information organization and presentation ."
Research questions	"The Interaction Flow in Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery ( IF-SKD ) model includes these themes , and accommodates iterative , evolving search interests ."
Research findings/conclusions	Output can be presented in a manner to enhance short-term memory conceptualization and connections with prior knowledge .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the IF-SKD model is currently a theoretical structure , its utility is demonstrated through replicating a literature-based discovery event , using a documented search method within the model 's steps ."
Research findings/conclusions	The IF-SKD model can potentially serve as the foundation for future literature-based discovery applications .
Research questions	"With the increasing availability of K-12 science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ) digital library content , alignment of that content with educational standards is a significant and continuous challenge ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Whereas direct , one-to-one alignment of standards is preferable but currently unsustainable in its resource demands , less resource-intensive intermediary-based alignment offers an interesting alternative ."
Research questions	But will it work ?
Research method	We present the results from an experiment in which the machine-based Standard Alignment Tool ( SAT ) incorporated in the National Science Digital Library ( NSDL ) was used to collect over half a million direct alignments between standards from different standard-authoring bodies .
Research method	These were then used to compute intermediary-based alignments derived from the well-known AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks and NSES standards .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show strong variation among authoring bodies in their success at crosswalking , with the best results for those who modeled their standards on the intermediaries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results furthermore show a strong inverse relationship between recall and precision when both intermediates were involved in the crosswalking .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our research uncovers the best core set of relevant indices for predicting other bibliometric indices .
Research findings/conclusions	"An added difficulty is to select the role of each variable , that is , which bibliometric indices are predictive variables and which are response variables ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This results in a novel multioutput regression problem where the role of each variable ( predictor or response ) is unknown beforehand .
Research method	We use Gaussian Bayesian networks to solve the this problem and discover multivariate relationships among bibliometric indices .
Research method	These networks are learnt by a genetic algorithm that looks for the optimal models that best predict bibliometric data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that the optimal induced Gaussian Bayesian networks corroborate previous relationships between several indices , but also suggest new , previously unreported interactions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An extended analysis of the best model illustrates that a set of 12 bibliometric indices can be accurately predicted using only a smaller predictive core subset composed of citations , g-index , q ( 2 ) -index , and h ( r ) -index ."
Research method	This research is performed using bibliometric data on Spanish full professors associated with the computer science area .
Research value/outlook/limitations	It has been applied to many applications in many different research and industrial areas .
Research method	Term-weighting schemes assign an appropriate weight to each term to obtain a high TC performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although term weighting is one of the important modules for TC and TC has different peculiarities from those in information retrieval , many term-weighting schemes used in information retrieval , such as term frequency-inverse document frequency ( tf-idf ) , have been used in TC in the same manner ."
Research findings/conclusions	The peculiarity of TC that differs most from information retrieval is the existence of class information .
Research method	This article proposes a new term-weighting scheme that uses class information using positive and negative class distributions .
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , the proposed scheme , log tf-TRR , consistently performs better than do other schemes using class information as well as traditional schemes such as tf-idf ."
Research method	"Typically , a researcher browses through a list of publications and traces additional relevant publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When relevant publications are identified , the list may be expanded by the citation links of the relevant publications ."
Research findings/conclusions	The information needs of researchers may change as they go through such iterative processes .
Research findings/conclusions	The exploration process quickly becomes cumbersome as the list expands .
Research questions	Most existing academic search systems tend to be limited in terms of the extent to which searchers can adapt their search as they proceed .
Research questions	"In this article , we introduce an adaptive visual exploration system named PaperPoles to support exploration of scientific publications in a context-aware environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	Searchers can express their information needs by intuitively formulating positive and negative queries .
Research findings/conclusions	"The search results are grouped and displayed in a cluster view , which shows aspects and relevance patterns of the results to support navigation and exploration ."
Research method	We conducted an experiment to compare PaperPoles with a list-based interface in performing two academic search tasks with different complexity .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that PaperPoles can improve the accuracy of searching for the simple and complex tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	It can also reduce the completion time of searching and improve exploration effectiveness in the complex task .
Research findings/conclusions	PaperPoles demonstrates a potentially effective workflow for adaptive visual search of complex information .
Research questions	CNI posits the existence of nonvolitional mechanisms that force information behaviors beyond the control of the individual .
Research findings/conclusions	"The CNI model consists of six primary CNI types : intrinsic somatic barriers , socio-environmental barriers , authoritarian barriers , threshold knowledge shortfall barriers , attention shortfall barriers , and filtering barriers ."
Research questions	This typology of information interaction limitations functions across a full range of socio-economic contexts and thus lends itself to analysis of intractable power-based inequities such as intimate partner violence ( IPV ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"IPV includes physical , mental , financial , and social attacks that , if known , generate socially sanctioned responses of both formal ( e.g. , law enforcement ) and informal ( e.g. , pastoral ) approaches ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Using the CNI framework to analyze information factors in distinct facets of the IPV experience , as identified in the cross disciplinary research on this phenomenon , this article provides a practical application of CNI to a complicated , high-risk phenomenon ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study examined how researchers stay up to date , using the information journey model as a framework for analysis and investigating which dimensions influence information behaviors ."
Research method	We designed a 2-round study involving semistructured interviews and prototype testing with 61 researchers with 3 levels of seniority ( PhD student to professor ) .
Research method	Data were analyzed following a semistructured qualitative approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"Five key dimensions that influence information behaviors were identified : level of seniority , information sources , state of the project , level of familiarity , and how well defined the relevant community is ."
Research findings/conclusions	These dimensions are interrelated and their values determine the flow of the information journey .
Research method	"Across all levels of professional expertise , researchers used similar hard ( formal ) sources to access content , while soft ( interpersonal ) sources were used to filter information ."
Research findings/conclusions	An important pain point that future information tools should address is helping researchers filter information at the point of need .
Research questions	"An interdisciplinary line of research has been established that empirically assesses the phenomenon of scientific misconduct using information on retractions , and thus aims to shed light on aspects of misconduct that previously were hidden ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , comparability and interpretability of studies are to a certain extent impeded by an absence of standards in corpus delineation and by the fact that the validity of this empirical data basis has never been systematically scrutinized ."
Research method	"This article assesses the conceptual and empirical delineation of retractions against related publication types through a comparative analysis of the coverage and consistency of retraction annotation in the databases PubMed and the Web of Science ( WoS ) , which are both commonly used for empicial studies on retractions ."
Research method	The searching and linking approaches of the WoS were subsequently evaluated .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that a considerable number of PubMed retracted publications and retractions are not labeled as such in the WoS or are indistinguishable from corrections , which is highly relevant for corpus and sample strategies in the WoS ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research .
Research method	RPYS is based on the analysis of the frequency with which references are cited in the publications of a specific research field in terms of the publication years of these cited references .
Research findings/conclusions	The origins show up in the form of more or less pronounced peaks mostly caused by individual publications that are cited particularly frequently .
Research method	"In this study , we use research on graphene and on solar cells to illustrate how RPYS functions , and what results it can deliver ."
Research questions	"This new type of document will evolve from the combination of contemporary participatory , transmedia storytelling with pervasive computing technologies and multisensory interfaces ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is argued that a research program within library and information science is needed , to investigate new information behaviors associated with such documents , the new digital literacies needed to make effective use of them , and their place in the information communication chain ."
Research questions	This study seeks to understand the differences between these two interfaces and how they affect the search experience of the novice user .
Research method	"In this study , 40 participants were asked to search for resources using both interfaces ."
Research method	"Their search times and accuracy were measured across three types of search tasks ( known , partially known , and exploratory ) ."
Research method	"After completing the searches , they were asked a series of questions about their experiences ."
Research method	The data were analyzed in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in both search interfaces .
Research findings/conclusions	Thirty-six out of 40 participants preferred the TextFacet interface to the TextOnly interface .
Research method	"Using three dependent variables-time , accuracy , and rating-the two interfaces were compared and interactions were tested with the three task types ."
Research findings/conclusions	Search times for the TextFacet were shorter and participants preferred the TextFacet search interface over the TextOnly search interface .
Research findings/conclusions	Performances across the three task types were different in terms of search time .
Research findings/conclusions	The partially known and exploratory task types showed similar distributions for rating and accuracy .
Research findings/conclusions	These distributions were distinctly different from the known task type .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of this study may assist libraries in developing improved library catalog search interfaces that utilize facets as well as text searching .
Research method	"To explore whether autocomplete functions reduce the impact of dyslexia on information searching , 20 participants with dyslexia and 20 controls solved 10 predefined tasks in the search engine Google ."
Research method	Eye-tracking and screen-capture documented the searches .
Research findings/conclusions	"There were no significant differences between the dyslexic students and the controls in time usage , number of queries , query lengths , or the use of the autocomplete function ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , participants with dyslexia made more misspellings and looked less at the screen and the autocomplete suggestions lists while entering the queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that although the autocomplete function supported the participants in the search process , a more extensive use of the autocomplete function would have reduced misspellings ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , the high tolerance for spelling errors considerably reduced the effect of dyslexia , and may be as important as the autocomplete function ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It is found that the GO deviates in some respects from its principles of ontological realism , and it is suggested the two forms of vocabulary could benefit from adopting good practice from the other ."
Research questions	"We examine how social informatics researchers have studied knowledge , computerization , and the workplace , and how all of those have evolved over time ."
Research method	"We describe the process by which articles were included , how they help us understand the field of social informatics scholarship today , and reflect briefly on what the future of the field holds ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Egghe argued that a good impact measure should reward nonconsistency ; that is , the more citations over papers are unequally distributed , the higher the impact should be ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Here , a quantitative proxy for consistency is offered , and it is shown that as consistency increases , the ideal performance measure , which is sensitive to changes in consistency , should increase , reflecting this virtue ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study uses the lens of human information interaction to investigate finding aid use .
Research method	Data were collected through a lab-based study of 32 experienced archives ' users who completed two tasks with each of two finding aids .
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants were able to carry out the tasks , but they were somewhat challenged by the structure of the finding aid and employed various techniques to cope ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Their patterns of interaction differed by task type and they reported higher rates of satisfaction , ease of use , and clarity for the assessment task than the known-item task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Four common patterns of interaction were identified : top-down , bottom-up , interrogative , and opportunistic ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results show how users interact with Research findings/conclusions aids and identify features that support and hinder use .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research examines process and performance in addition to outcomes .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Results contribute to the archival science literature and also suggest ways to extend models of human information interaction .
Research findings/conclusions	"Just as with data , the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways , and so promote efficient science ."
Research method	"In this article , we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles ."
Research method	We develop a coding scheme to identify software mentions and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , we find diverse and problematic practices : Only between 31 % and 43 % of mentions involve formal citations ; informal mentions are very common , even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software ."
Research findings/conclusions	Software is frequently inaccessible ( 15 % -29 % of packages in any form ; between 90 % and 98 % of specific versions ; only between 24 % -40 % provide source code ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information , whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation , highlighting recent nascent efforts ."
Research questions	Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice ; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication .
Research questions	"To optimize the utilization of knowledge in organizations , it is crucial to identify factors that influence knowledge popularity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"From a network perspective , this study proposes a model to evaluate knowledge popularity by investigating 2 attributes of contextual information ( i.e. , authors and tags ) that are embedded in a heterogeneous knowledge network , and how they interact to impact knowledge popularity ."
Research method	Objective data obtained through the interaction history of a KMS in a global telecommunication company was applied to test the hypotheses .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper contributes to the extant literature on knowledge popularity by identifying contextual attributions of knowledge , and empirically tests the impact of their interactions on knowledge popularity ."
Research method	The conceptual framework for the study is Kuhlthau 's 6-stage information-search process ( ISP ) model .
Research questions	The objective of the study is to test and extend ISP model concepts .
Research method	"As per other ISP model studies , our study measured the evolution of the feelings , thoughts , and actions of the study participants over the 3-month period of their class project ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The unique feature of this study is the unlimited access the researchers had to a real-life history class , resulting in 12 separate measuring periods ."
Research findings/conclusions	We report 2 important Research findings/conclusions of the study .
Research method	"First , through factor analysis , we determined 5 factors that define the temporality of completing an inquiry-based project for these grade 8 students ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The second main finding is the importance of the students ' consultations with their classmates , siblings , parents , and teachers in the construction of the knowledge necessary to complete their project ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Not only did female candidates tweet more often , but they also spent more time attacking their opponents and discussing important issues in American politics ."
Research questions	"In this article , we examine whether the female winners of those races acted differently than the male winners in the 2012 election , and whether they differed in their tweeting-style during two months in the summer of 2013 ."
Research method	"Using a hand-coded content analysis of every tweet from each member in the U.S. House of Representatives in June and July of 2013 , we show that women differ from their male colleagues in their frequency and type of tweeting , and note some key differences between the period during the election and the period after ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article suggests that context greatly affects representatives ' Twitter-style .
Research findings/conclusions	"Information is illustrated by some new facts concerning The BKCI 's use in bibliometrics , coverage analysis , and a series of idiosyncrasies worthy of further discussion ."
Research questions	"The BKCI was launched primarily to assist researchers identify useful and relevant research that was previously invisible to them , owing to the lack of significant book content in citation indexes such as the Web of Science ."
Research findings/conclusions	"So far , the content of 33,000 books has been added to the desktops of the global research community , the majority in the arts , humanities , and social sciences fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Initial analyses of the data from The BKCI have indicated that The BKCI , in its current version , should not be used for bibliometric or evaluative Research questionss ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information , the inflation of publication counts , the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels , and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index ."
Research questions	"However , The BKCI is a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs- a very challenging issue , because , unlike journals and conference proceedings , books have specific requirements , and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification , but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications ."
Research method	Scholarly publications are analyzed to track and trace breakthrough processes as well as their impact on world science .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The focus in this study is on the incremental discovery of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic system in the late 1970s by a small international team of collaborating researchers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Analysis of their groundbreaking research articles , all produced within a relatively short period of time , and the network of citing articles shows the cumulative effects of the intense collaboration within a small group of researchers working on the same subject ."
Research method	Using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database and the PATSTAT patents database in combination with expert opinions shows that these discoveries accumulated into a new technology .
Research findings/conclusions	These first Research findings/conclusions suggest that potential breakthrough discoveries can be identified at a relatively early stage by careful analysis of publication and citation patterns .
Research method	"There are three representative smoothing methods : Jelinek-Mercer ( JM ) method ; Bayesian smoothing using Dirichlet priors ( Dir ) method ; and absolute discounting ( Dis ) method , whose parameters are usually estimated empirically ."
Research questions	"Previous research in information retrieval ( IR ) on smoothing parameter estimation tends to select a single value from optional values for the collection , but it may not be appropriate for all the queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The effectiveness of all the optional values should be considered to improve the ranking performance .
Research questions	"Recently , learning to rank has become an effective approach to optimize the ranking accuracy by merging the existing retrieval methods ."
Research questions	"In this article , the smoothing methods for language modeling in information retrieval ( LMIR ) with different parameters are treated as different retrieval methods , then a learning to rank approach to learn a ranking model based on the features extracted by smoothing methods is presented ."
Research method	"In the process of learning , the effectiveness of all the optional smoothing parameters is taken into account for all queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results on the Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval ( LETOR ) LETOR3.0 and LETOR4.0 data sets show that our approach is effective in improving the performance of LMIR .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , when presented with many evidence documents , users do not necessarily read and trust them uniformly ."
Research questions	"Psychologists and other researchers have shown that users tend to follow and agree with articles and sources that hold viewpoints similar to their own , a phenomenon known as confirmation bias ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This suggests that when learning about a controversial topic , human biases and viewpoints about the topic may affect what is considered trustworthy or credible ."
Research questions	It is an interesting challenge to build systems that can help users overcome this bias and help them decide the truthfulness of claims .
Research questions	"In this article , we study various factors that enable humans to acquire additional information about controversial claims in an unbiased fashion ."
Research questions	"Specifically , we designed a user study to understand how presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise ratings affect how users learn from the evidence documents ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves , but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , explicit knowledge of the credibility of the sources and the context in which the source provides the evidence document not only affects what users read but also whether they perceive the document to be credible ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although some previous studies focused on assisting professionals in the retrieval of related legal documents , they did not take into account the general public and their difficulty in describing legal problems in professional legal terms ."
Research questions	"Because this problem has not been addressed by previous research , this study aims to design a text-mining-based method that allows the general public to use everyday vocabulary to search for and retrieve criminal judgments ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results indicate that our method can help the general public , who are not familiar with professional legal terms , to acquire relevant criminal judgments more accurately and effectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	Does the fact that the author of an article knows the author whose work he or she cites have an impact on the context of the citation ?
Research findings/conclusions	"Because citations are commonly used as criteria for research evaluation , it is important to question their social background to better understand how it impacts textual features ."
Research method	"We studied a collection of science articles ( N = 123 ) from 5 disciplines and interviewed their authors ( N = 84 ) to : ( a ) identify the social relations between citing and cited authors ; and ( b ) measure the correlation between a set of features related to in-text citations ( N = 6,956 ) and the identified social relations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our pioneering work , mixing sociological and linguistic results , shows that social relations between authors can partly explain the variations of citations in terms of frequency , position and textual context ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In drawing data from the popular review platform Amazon , results indicate that review helpfulness is positively related to reviewer profile and review depth but is negatively related to review rating ."
Research findings/conclusions	Users seem to have a proclivity for reviews contributed by reviewers with a positive track record .
Research value/outlook/limitations	They also appreciate reviews with lambasting comments and those with adequate depth .
Research findings/conclusions	"By highlighting its implications for theory and practice , the article concludes with limitations and areas for further research ."
Research questions	"Mediated search provides an opportunity to elaborate on this idea , as an intermediary 's elicitations reveal what aspects of the user model they think are worth inquiring about ."
Research questions	"However , empirical evidence is divided over whether intermediaries actually work to develop a broadly conceived user model ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our research revisits the issue in a web research services setting , whose characteristics are expected to result in more thorough user modeling on the part of intermediaries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our empirical study confirms that intermediaries engage in rich user modeling .
Research findings/conclusions	"While intermediaries behave differently across settings , our interpretation is that the underlying user model characteristics that intermediaries inquire about in our setting are applicable to other settings as well ."
Research method	Forty-eight ELL students from three classes at a high school participated in the study while they conducted a research project in English .
Research method	Data were collected through demographic questionnaire and process surveys .
Research method	"Students ' demographic information , knowledge about their research topic , labeling of knowledge , estimate of interest and knowledge , and learning outcomes were collected and analyzed with content analysis and statistical techniques ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate that ELL students , as a whole group , showed significant increases in their topical knowledge and estimate of interest and knowledge as they progressed in the research project , which are consistent with what other ISP-based studies found ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When three different English proficiency-level groups were compared , only the intermediate group showed significant increases in topical knowledge and estimate of knowledge throughout the process ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , different research tasks impacted the amount and substance of knowledge students built and their estimated knowledge during the research project ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions led to suggestions for instructional strategies such as learning goals reflecting various kinds of learning , differentiated instructions in mixed-ability classrooms , structured interventions , personalized research topics , and teacher-school librarian collaborations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The automation of textual entailment recognition supports a wide variety of text-based tasks , including information retrieval , information extraction , question answering , text summarization , and machine translation ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Much ingenuity has been devoted to developing algorithms for identifying textual entailments , but relatively little to saying what textual entailment actually is ."
Research questions	This article is a review of the logical and philosophical issues involved in providing an adequate definition of textual entailment .
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that many natural definitions of textual entailment are refuted by counterexamples , including the most widely cited definition of Dagan et al ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We then articulate and defend the following revised definition : T textually entails H = ( df ) typically , a human reading T would be justified in inferring the proposition expressed by H from the proposition expressed by T. We also show that textual entailment is context-sensitive , nontransitive , and nonmonotonic ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study proposes a research model from a knowledge power perspective , that is , Internet search affects patients ' perception of their knowledge level ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our empirical study of more than 400 subjects suggests that for patients who searched online for disease information , the inconsistency between their self-diagnosis expectations and their physician 's diagnosis reduces their trust in their physician ."
Research findings/conclusions	The effect is stronger for those who spent more time on Internet search .
Research findings/conclusions	"Patients with chronic conditions are less affected by the inconsistency , as are patients of physicians with a higher professional status ."
Research findings/conclusions	This study also found that physicians ' interaction quality in the diagnosis processhow well they communicate with their patientstill plays a dominant role in gaining patient 's trust .
Research findings/conclusions	"This finding suggests that even in the high-tech age , high-touch remains an important factor to physician-patient trust ."
Research questions	"When selecting expansion terms , most traditional models do not simultaneously consider term frequency and the co-occurrence relationships between candidate terms and query terms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Intuitively , however , a term that has a higher co-occurrence with a query term is more likely to be related to the query topic ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a kernel co-occurrence-based framework to enhance retrieval performance by integrating term co-occurrence information into the Rocchio model and a relevance language model ( RM3 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Specifically , a kernel co-occurrence-based Rocchio method ( KRoc ) and a kernel co-occurrence-based RM3 method ( KRM3 ) are proposed ."
Research method	"In our framework , co-occurrence information is incorporated into both the factor of the term discrimination power and the factor of the within-document term weight to boost retrieval performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of a series of experiments show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the corresponding strong baselines over all data sets in terms of the mean average precision and over most data sets in terms of P @ 10 .
Research findings/conclusions	A direct comparison of standard Text Retrieval Conference data sets indicates that our proposed methods are at least comparable to state-of-the-art approaches .
Research method	This article describes the design and development of a novel ontology-based framework to illustrate how ontologies can interface with distributed data sources .
Research method	The framework is then tested using a survey instrument and an integrated research model of user satisfaction and technology acceptance .
Research questions	"A description is provided of extensions to an industry standard ontology , specifically the Financial Industry Business Ontology ( FIBO ) , towards enabling greater data interchange ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results reveal a significant reduction in manual processes , increase in data quality , and improved data aggregation by employing the framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	The research model reveals the range of factors that drive acceptance of the framework .
Research findings/conclusions	Additional interview evidence reveals that the ontological framework also allows organizations to react to regulatory changes with much-improved timeframes and provides opportunities to test for data quality .
Research method	"I first unpack the mainstream , autonomy-centric discourse of privacy , and then present a research model that illustrates a possible new theorization of the relationship between self-identity and information privacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	An empirical study with Facebook users confirms the main hypotheses .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the data show that the need for self-identity is positively related to privacy management behaviors , which in turn result in increased self-disclosure in online social networks ."
Research questions	"I subsequently argue that the so-called privacy paradox is not a paradox per se in the context of online social networking ; rather , privacy concerns reflect the ideology of an autonomous self , whereas social construction of self-identity explains voluntary self-disclosure ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , little research has been devoted to exploring the impact of various factors such as the content of a resource or crowdsourcing interface design on user tagging behavior ."
Research questions	"Although images ' titles and descriptions are frequently available in image digital libraries , it is not clear whether they should be displayed to crowdworkers engaged in tagging ."
Research questions	"This paper focuses on offering insight to the curators of digital image libraries who face this dilemma by examining ( i ) how descriptions influence the user in his/her tagging behavior and ( ii ) how this relates to the ( a ) nature of the tags , ( b ) the emergent folksonomy , and ( c ) the findability of the images in the tagging system ."
Research method	We compared two different methods for collecting image tags from Amazon 's Mechanical Turk 's crowdworkerswith and without image descriptions .
Research questions	"Several properties of generated tags were examined from different perspectives : diversity , specificity , reusability , quality , similarity , descriptiveness , and so on ."
Research method	"In addition , the study was carried out to examine the impact of image description on supporting users ' information seeking with a tag cloud interface ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results showed that the properties of tags are affected by the crowdsourcing approach .
Research findings/conclusions	"Tags from the with description condition are more diverse and more specific than tags from the without description condition , while the latter has a higher tag reuse rate ."
Research findings/conclusions	A user study also revealed that different tag sets provided different support for search .
Research findings/conclusions	"Tags produced with description shortened the path to the target results , whereas tags produced without description increased user success in the search task ."
Research findings/conclusions	They may be looking for social connectivity with compassionate strangers who may have experienced similar situations to share opinions and experiences rather than for authoritative medical information .
Research questions	Previous studies document distinct technological features and different levels of social support interaction patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	It is expected that the design of the social media functions will have an impact on the user behavior of social support exchange .
Research method	"In this part of a multipart study , we investigate the social support types , in particular information support types , across multiple computer-mediated communication formats ( forum , journal , and notes ) within an alcoholism community using descriptive content analysis on 3 months of data from a MedHelp online peer support community ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We present the results of identified informational support types including advice , referral , fact , personal experiences , and opinions , either offered or requested ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Fact type was exchanged most often among the messages ; however , there were some different patterns between notes and journal posts ."
Research findings/conclusions	Notes were used for maintaining relationships rather than as a main source for seeking information .
Research findings/conclusions	"Notes were similar to comments made to journal posts , which may indicate the friendship between journal readers and the author ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions suggest that users may have initially joined the MedHelpAlcoholism Community for information-seeking Research questionss but continue participation even after they have completed with information gathering because of the relationships they formed with community members through social media features .
Research method	"Two theoretical perspectives , institutional theory , and theory of planned behavior , were employed in developing a research model that showed the complementary nature of the institutional and individual factors influencing scientists ' data-sharing behaviors ."
Research method	This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those institutional and individual factors influence scientists ' data-sharing behaviors in a range of scientific disciplines .
Research findings/conclusions	"A national survey ( with 1,317 scientists in 43 disciplines ) showed that regulative pressure by journals , normative pressure at a discipline level , and perceived career benefit and scholarly altruism at an individual level had significant positive relationships with data-sharing behaviors , and that perceived effort had a significant negative relationship ."
Research findings/conclusions	Regulative pressure by funding agencies and the availability of data repositories at a discipline level and perceived career risk at an individual level were not found to have any significant relationships with data-sharing behaviors .
Research questions	"Recent literature has reported the development of efficient local-pattern-based descriptors , including the local vector pattern ( LVP ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article extends the LVP formulation by making it more computationally efficient and informative .
Research method	"In the extended LVP-based extraction process , the global index angles are determined using the mutual information between the patterns , which are obtained from a pair of indexed angles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , the Proposed LVP ( PLVP ) no longer requires a step to identify patterns in every indexed angle found in the querying phase of the CBIR system ."
Research method	"A CBIR system with the PLVP is developed in this article , and the system and its associated methods are tested using data from a benchmark texture database and a natural image database ."
Research method	"A performance comparison of the PLVP and traditional patterns , such as the local binary pattern ( LBP ) , completely modeled local binary pattern ( CLBP ) and local tetra pattern ( LTrP ) , is conducted using the CBIR system ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results reveal the superiority of the PLVP in terms of precision , recall , F-score and computational efficiency ."
Research questions	"However , such research typically operationalizes health information acquisition with knowledge tests ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Information scientists who investigate socially embedded information behaviors could help improve understanding of potential associations between information behavior-as opposed to knowledge-and health behavior formation , thus providing new opportunities to investigate the effects of health information ."
Research questions	"We examine the associations between information behavior and HIV testing intentions among young men who have sex with men ( YMSM ) , a group with high rates of unrecognized HIV infection ."
Research method	We used the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) to predict intentions to seek HIV testing in an online sample of 163 YMSM .
Research method	"Multiple regression and recursive path analysis were used to test two models : ( a ) the basic TPB model and ( b ) an adapted model that added the direct effects of three information behaviors ( information exposure , use of information to make HIV-testing decisions , prior experience obtaining an HIV test ) plus self-rated HIV knowledge ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As hypothesized , our adapted model improved predictions , explaining more than twice as much variance as the original TPB model ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that information behaviors may be more important predictors of health behavior intentions than previously acknowledged .
Research questions	"It examines in detail the variable rate of knowledge production in the field , shifts in subject coverage , the dominance of particular publication genres at different times , prevailing modes of production , interactions with other disciplines , and , more generally , observes how the field has evolved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It shows that , despite a striking growth in the number of journals , papers , and contributing authors , a decrease was observed in the field 's market-share of all social science and humanities research ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Collaborative authorship is now the norm , a pattern seen across the social sciences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The idea of boundary crossing was also examined : in 2010 , nearly 60 % of authors who published in LIS also published in another discipline ."
Research findings/conclusions	This high degree of permeability in LIS was also demonstrated through reference and citation practices : LIS scholars now cite and receive citations from other fields more than from LIS itself .
Research findings/conclusions	"Two major structural shifts are revealed in the data : in 1960 , LIS changed from a professional field focused on librarianship to an academic field focused on information and use ; and in 1990 , LIS began to receive a growing number of citations from outside the field , notably from Computer Science and Management , and saw a dramatic increase in the number of authors contributing to the literature of the field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This gap can be filled by Mendeley reader counts , which are valuable early impact indicators for academic articles because they appear before citations and correlate strongly with them ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , it is not known how Mendeley readership counts accumulate within the year of publication , and so it is unclear how soon they can be used ."
Research method	"In response , this paper reports a longitudinal weekly study of the Mendeley readers of articles in 6 library and information science journals from 2016 ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest that Mendeley readers accrue from when articles are first available online and continue to steadily build .
Research findings/conclusions	"For journals with large publication delays , articles can already have substantial numbers of readers by their publication date ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , Mendeley reader counts may even be useful as early impact indicators for articles before they have been officially published in a journal issue ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If field normalized indicators are needed , then these can be generated when journal issues are published using the online first date ."
Research questions	"However , they rarely make use of the interrelationship among documents on readability , which can help increase the accuracy of readability assessment ."
Research method	"In this article , we adopt a graph-based classification method to model and utilize the relationship among documents using the coupled bag-of-words model ."
Research method	We propose a word coupling method to build the coupled bag-of-words model by estimating the correlation between words on reading difficulty .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , we propose a two-view graph propagation method to make use of both the coupled bag-of-words model and the linguistic features ."
Research method	"Our method employs a graph merging operation to combine graphs built according to different views , and improves the label propagation by incorporating the ordinal relation among reading levels ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments were conducted on both English and Chinese data sets , and the results demonstrate both effectiveness and potential of the method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"From submissions and subscriptions to grants and hirings , researchers , policy makers , and funding agencies make important decisions influenced by journal rankings such as the ISI journal impact factor ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Typically , the rankings are derived from the citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this selection ."
Research questions	"However , little is known about how robust rankings are to the selection of included journals ."
Research method	We compare the robustness of three journal rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks .
Research method	"They model pathways of researchers navigating the scholarly literature , stepping between journals and remembering their previous steps to different degrees : zero-step memory as impact factor , one-step memory as Eigenfactor , and two-step memory , corresponding to zero- , first- , and second-order Markov models of citation flow between journals ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better and are more robust to the selection of journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Whereas our analysis indicates that higher-order models perform better , the performance gain for higher-order Markov models comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In all , 798 authors contributed to 305 top 1 % publications ; these authors were employed at 275 institutions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The authors at Harvard University contributed the largest number of papers , when the addresses are whole-number counted ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , Leiden University leads the ranking if fractional counting is used ."
Research findings/conclusions	Twenty-three of the 798 authors were also listed as most highly cited authors by Thomson Reuters in June 2014 ( ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Twelve of these 23 authors were involved in publishing 4 or more of the 305 papers under study .
Research findings/conclusions	Analysis of coauthorship relations among the 798 highly cited scientists shows that coauthorships are based on common interests in a specific topic .
Research findings/conclusions	Three topics were important between 2002 and 2012 : ( a ) collection and exploitation of information in clinical practices ; ( b ) use of the Internet in public communication and commerce ; and ( c ) scientometrics .
Research questions	"Therefore , an understanding of this search engine traffic is critical to the success of these websites ."
Research findings/conclusions	Understanding search engine traffic means understanding the underlying intent of the query terms and the corresponding user behaviors of searchers submitting keywords .
Research method	"In this research , using 712,643 query keywords from a popular Spanish music website relying on contextual advertising as its business model , we use a k-means clustering algorithm to categorize the referral keywords with similar characteristics of onsite customer behavior , including attributes such as clickthrough rate and revenue ."
Research findings/conclusions	We identified 6 clusters of consumer keywords .
Research findings/conclusions	Clusters range from a large number of users who are low impact to a small number of high impact users .
Research findings/conclusions	We demonstrate how online businesses can leverage this segmentation clustering approach to provide a more tailored consumer experience .
Research findings/conclusions	Implications are that businesses can effectively segment customers to develop better business models to increase advertising conversion rates .
Research method	"The inquiry is grounded by data from a study of 2 ecovillages , intentional communities striving to ground their daily activities in a set of core values related to sustainability ."
Research method	"Ethnographic methods employed for over 2 years resulted in data from hundreds of hours of participant observation , semistructured interviews with 22 community members , and a diverse collection of community images and texts ."
Research findings/conclusions	Analysis of the data highlights the tensions that arose and remained as community members experienced breakdowns between community values related to sustainability and their daily information practices .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Contributions to the field of information science include the development of the concept of sustainable information practice , an analysis of why community members felt unable to adapt their information practices to better match community concepts of sustainability , and an assessment of the methodological challenges of information practice inquiry within a communal , nonwork environment ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most broadly , this work contributes to our larger understanding of the challenges faced by those attempting to identify and develop more sustainable information practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , Research findings/conclusions from this investigation call into question previous claims that groups of individuals with strong value commitments can adapt their use of information tools to better support their values ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In contrast , this work suggests that information practices can be particularly resilient to local , value-based adaptation ."
Research method	It comprises several excellent scholarly research articles previously published in JASIST with important implications for the design of digital information environments .
Research method	"It covers articles that motivate the need for Information Science research to inform design and those that have empirically examined information-related concepts such as information behavior , practices , interaction , and experience and , based on their Research findings/conclusions , proposed recommendations or posed questions for design ."
Research questions	"This article argues that as JASIST exists at the intersection between information , systems , and users , it is natural to want to understand how people engage with information to inform design and , by doing so , Information Science research can build bridges between Information Science and computing disciplines and make contributions that transcend its discipline boundaries ."
Research questions	It argues that Information Science research not only has the potential but also the duty to inform the design of future digital information environments .
Research questions	"In particular , we examine the contributions of authors outside the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada ; faculty in departments other than LIS ; and practicing librarians ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Worldwide , faculty in LIS departments account for 31 % of the journal literature ; librarians , 23 % ; computer science faculty , 10 % ; and management faculty , 10 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The top contributing nations are the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , China , Canada , and Taiwan ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Within the United States and the United Kingdom , the current productivity of LIS departments is correlated with past productivity and with other measures of reputation and performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More generally , the distribution of contributions is highly skewed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the United States , five departments account for 27 % of the articles contributed by LIS faculty ; in the United Kingdom , four departments account for nearly two-thirds of the articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This skewed distribution reinforces the possibility that high-status departments may gain a permanent advantage in the competition for students , faculty , journal space , and research funding ."
Research findings/conclusions	"At the same time , concentrations of research-active faculty in particular departments may generate beneficial spillover effects ."
Research questions	"However , when the number of social tags grows rapidly , using them becomes problematic and , as a result , they are often left as simply big data that can not be used for practical Research questionss ."
Research questions	"To revitalize the use of this crowd-sourced information , we propose using social tags to link and cluster artworks based on an experimental study using an online collection at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art ( GMoMA ) ."
Research questions	"We view social tagging as a folksonomy , where artworks are classified by keywords of the crowd 's various interpretations and one artwork can belong to several different categories simultaneously ."
Research method	"To leverage this strength of social tags , we used a clustering method called link communities to detect overlapping communities in a network of artworks constructed by computing similarities between all artwork pairs ."
Research method	We used this framework to identify semantic relationships and clusters of similar artworks .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By comparing the clustering results with curators ' manual classification results , we demonstrated the potential of social tagging data for automatically clustering artworks in a way that reflects the dynamic perspectives of crowds ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are two major limitations of such system-centered evaluation approaches : ( a ) The evaluation focuses on subtasks in music information retrieval , but not on entire systems and ( b ) users and their interactions with MIR systems are largely excluded ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article describes the first implementation of a holistic user-experience evaluation in MIR , the MIREX Grand Challenge , where complete MIR systems are evaluated , with user experience being the single overarching goal ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It is the first time that complete MIR systems have been evaluated with end users in a realistic scenario .
Research method	"We present the design of the evaluation task , the evaluation criteria and a novel evaluation interface , and the data-collection platform ."
Research method	"This is followed by an analysis of the results , reflection on the experience and lessons learned , and plans for future directions ."
Research questions	"As the number of posted questions and answers ( QAs ) continues to increase rapidly , the massive amount of question-answer knowledge is causing information overload ."
Research findings/conclusions	The problem is compounded by the growing number of redundant QAs .
Research findings/conclusions	SQA websites such as Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Answers are open platforms where users can freely ask or answer questions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Users also may wish to learn more about the information provided in an answer so they can use related keywords in the answer to search for extended , complementary information ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a novel approach to identify complementary QAs ( CQAs ) of a target QA ."
Research findings/conclusions	We define two types of complementarity : partial complementarity and extended complementarity .
Research method	"First , we utilize a classification-based approach to predict complementary relationships between QAs based on three measures : question similarity , answer novelty , and answer correlation ."
Research method	Then we construct a CQA network based on the derived complementary relationships .
Research method	"In addition , we introduce a CQA network analysis technique that searches the QA network to find direct and indirect CQAs of the target QA ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of experiments conducted on the data collected from Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	Answers Taiwan show that the proposed approach can more effectively identify CQAs than can the conventional similarity-based method .
Research findings/conclusions	Case and user study results also validate the helpfulness and the effectiveness of our approach .
Research questions	"However , attachment is still a largely unexplored concept in both IS research and practice ."
Research questions	"Drawing from the literature on attachment in consumer behavior research and auxiliary theories in IS use and community participation research , this study theoretically identifies and empirically explores the concept of attachment and its antecedents ( i.e. , relative visual aesthetics , personalization , relative performance ) and outcome ( i.e. , community participation intention ) in the IS context ."
Research method	"Using web browsers as the target IS , an online survey was conducted ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results show that relative expressive visual aesthetics is the strongest antecedent of IS attachment , and that personalization is the second strongest antecedent of IS attachment , followed by relative performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , this study reveals that IS attachment has a strong positive impact on community participation intention ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This study contributes theoretically and empirically to the body of IS use research and has managerial implications , suggesting that although superior performance is a necessary condition for attachment formation , improving users ' experience through expressive visual aesthetics and personalization is critical to build strong attachment relationships with users ."
Research findings/conclusions	The governments of these countries have been boosting their investments in research and development to become part of the group of nations doing research at a world-class level .
Research method	This study investigates the development of the BRICS countries in the domain of top-cited papers ( top 10 % and 1 % most frequently cited papers ) between 1990 and 2010 .
Research method	"To assess the extent to which these countries have become important players at the top level , we compare the BRICS countries with the top-performing countries worldwide ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As the analyses of the ( annual ) growth rates show , with the exception of Russia , the BRICS countries have increased their output in terms of most frequently cited papers at a higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide ."
Research method	"By way of additional analysis , we generate coauthorship networks among authors of highly cited papers for 4 time points to view changes in BRICS participation ( 1995 , 2000 , 2005 , and 2010 ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Here , the results show that all BRICS countries succeeded in becoming part of this network , whereby the Chinese collaboration activities focus on the US ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although the most frequent reason to cite an article is to highlight the connection between the 2 publications , researchers sometimes mention an earlier work to cast a negative light ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While computing citation-based scores , for instance , the h-index , information about the reason why an article was mentioned is neglected ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , it can be questioned whether these indices describe scientific achievements accurately ."
Research method	"In this article we shed insight into the problem of negative citations , analyzing data from Stack Exchange and , to draw more universal conclusions , we derive an approximation of citations scores ."
Research findings/conclusions	Here we show that the quantified influence of introducing negative citations is of lesser importance and that they could be used as an indicator of where the attention of the scientific community is allocated .
Research findings/conclusions	The cataloging community is grappling with practical issues in navigating the transition from AACR2 to RDA ; there is a definite need to evaluate major subject areas and broader themes in information organization under the new RDA paradigm .
Research questions	This article aims to accomplish this task through a thorough and critical review of the emerging RDA literature published from 2005 to 2011 .
Research findings/conclusions	"The review mostly concerns key areas of difference between RDA and AACR2 , the relationship of the new cataloging code to metadata standards , the impact on encoding standards such as Machine-Readable Cataloging ( MARC ) , end user considerations , and practitioners ' views on RDA implementation and training ."
Research findings/conclusions	Future research will require more in-depth studies of RDA 's expected benefits and the manner in which the new cataloging code will improve resource retrieval and bibliographic control for users and catalogers alike over AACR2 .
Research findings/conclusions	"The question as to how the cataloging community can best move forward to the post-AACR2/MARC environment must be addressed carefully so as to chart the future of bibliographic control in the evolving environment of information production , management , and use ."
Research findings/conclusions	The traditional cluster hypothesis also does not consider the dependency between related queries .
Research questions	The goal of this paper is to leverage similar search intents to perform ranking consistency so that the search performance can be improved accordingly .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Different from the previous supervised approach , which learns relevance by click-through data , we propose a novel cocluster hypothesis to bridge the gap between relevance ranking and ranking consistency ."
Research method	A nearest-neighbors test is also designed to measure the extent to which the cocluster hypothesis holds .
Research method	"Based on the hypothesis , we further propose a two-stage unsupervised approach , in which two ranking heuristics and a cost function are developed to optimize the combination of consistency and uniqueness ( or inconsistency ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Extensive experiments have been conducted on a real and large-scale search engine log .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results not only verify the applicability of the proposed cocluster hypothesis but also show that our approach is effective in boosting the retrieval performance of the commercial search engine and reaches a comparable performance to the supervised approach .
Research method	"Based on a diary study of 2 assigned tasks to search on Google and Google Scholar , factor analysis identified the core constructs of content , relevance , scope , and style , as well as informational and system ease of use as influencing the judgment that useful information had been found ."
Research findings/conclusions	Differences were found in the participants ' evaluation of information across the search tasks on Google and on Google Scholar when identified by the factors related to both content and ease of use .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions from this study suggest how searchers might critically evaluate information , and the study identifies a relation between the user 's involvement in the information interaction and the influences of the perceived system ease of use and information design ."
Research questions	"However , many existing extraction methods are mainly in a supervised manner ."
Research questions	It is costly and time-consuming to manually label drug-disease pairs datasets .
Research value/outlook/limitations	There are many drug-disease pairs buried in free text .
Research method	"In this work , we first leverage a pattern-based method to automatically extract drug-disease pairs with treatment and inducement relationships from free text ."
Research method	"Then , to reflect a drug-disease relation , a network embedding algorithm is proposed to calculate the degree of correlation of a drug-disease pair ."
Research method	"In the experiments , we use the method to extract treatment and inducement drug-disease pairs from 27 million medical abstracts and titles available on PubMed ."
Research method	"We extract 138,318 unique treatment pairs and 75,396 unique inducement pairs ."
Research method	"Our algorithm achieves a precision of 0.912 and a recall of 0.898 in extracting the frequent treatment drug-disease pairs , and a precision of 0.923 and a recall of 0.833 in extracting the frequent inducement drug-disease pairs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Besides , our proposed information network embedding algorithm can efficiently reflect the degree of correlation of drug-disease pairs ."
Research method	"Our algorithm can achieve a precision of 0.802 , a recall of 0.783 in the fine-grained evaluation of extracting frequent pairs ."
Research questions	"Because of online accessibility , academic researchers tend to read more , and reading has become more superficial ( Olle & Borrego , ) , such that information overload has become an important issue ."
Research questions	"Given this circumstance , how the Internet affects knowledge transfer , or , more specifically , the citation behavior of researchers , has become a recent focus of interest ."
Research method	"This study assesses the effects of the Internet on citation patterns in terms of 4 characteristics of cited documents : topic relevance , author status , journal prestige , and age of references ."
Research method	"This work hypothesizes that academic scholars cite more topically relevant articles , more articles written by lower status authors , articles published in less prestigious journals , and older articles with online accessibility ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The current study also hypothesizes that researcher knowledge level moderates such Internet effects .
Research method	We chose the IT and Group subject area and collected 241 documents published in the pre-web period ( 1991-1995 ) and 867 documents published in the web-prevalent period ( 2006-2010 ) in the Web of Science database .
Research method	"The references of these documents were analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses , which are significantly supported by the empirical results ."
Research questions	"These changes have yielded a variety of new economic and academic niches , including journals with questionable peer-review systems and business models , commonly dubbed predatory publishing ."
Research findings/conclusions	Empirical analysis of Cabell & apos ; s Journal Blacklist reveals substantial diversity in types and degrees of predatory publishing .
Research findings/conclusions	"While some blacklisted publishers produce journals with many severe violations of academic norms , gray journals and publishers occupy borderline or ambiguous niches between predation and legitimacy ."
Research findings/conclusions	Predation in academic publishing is not a simple binary phenomenon and should instead be perceived as a spectrum with varying types and degrees of illegitimacy .
Research questions	Conceptions of predation are based on overlapping evaluations of academic and economic legitimacy .
Research findings/conclusions	"High institutional status benefits publishers by reducing conflicts between-if not aligning-professional and market institutional logics , which are more likely to conflict and create illegitimacy concerns in downmarket niches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"High rejection rates imbue high-status journals with value and pricing power , while low-status OA journals face predatory incentives to optimize revenue via low selectivity ."
Research questions	"Status influences the social acceptability of profit-seeking in academic publishing , rendering lower-status publishers vulnerable to being perceived and stigmatized as illegitimate ."
Research questions	He argues that a good impact measure works better when citations are concentrated rather than spread out over articles .
Research findings/conclusions	"The author also presents theoretical evidence that the g-index and the R-index can be close to the square root of the total number of citations , whereas this is not the case for the A-index ."
Research findings/conclusions	Here the author confirms an assertion of De Visscher .
Research questions	"We , instead , investigate online community defections , their cause , and their impact through an empirical investigation of defections from Wikipedia ."
Research method	Our research uses justice theory to determine the effects of injustice perceptions on contributor defections and draws on fairness heuristic theory to distinguish the relative effects of distributive injustice and procedural injustice .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that perceptions of injustice concerning collaboration outcomes ( distributive injustice ) raise contributor dissatisfaction , which in turn leads to defection ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Perceptions of injustice concerning the process ( procedural injustice ) , by comparison , have a direct impact on defections and exert a stronger influence on dissatisfaction than distributive injustice ."
Research findings/conclusions	Justice emerges as a hygiene factor adding to the level of dissatisfaction among dissatisfied contributors but not among satisfied contributors .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions contribute to our understanding of collaborative knowledge creation by drawing attention to contributors ' post hoc passive emotions and behaviors instead of predominantly investigating their initial prosharing behaviors .
Research findings/conclusions	The work also has practical implications for community governance because it suggests how to sustain communities in the long term .
Research method	"Using as an example the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) epidemic , we ( a ) examine challenges associated with what we term globalinformationcrises ; ( b ) recommend changes needed for the field of information science to play a leading role in such crises ; and ( c ) propose actionable items for short- and long-term research , education , and practice in information science ."
Research method	Our study uses a conversation analytic framework to investigate the types of potential or actual problems in communication that occur between librarians and patrons in chat reference interactions at a university library .
Research method	"Conversation analysis methodology , as developed by Harvey Sacks , Emanuel Schegloff , and Gain Jefferson , provides an empirical basis for claims about problems with communication by investigating what the participants themselves display as problematic or potentially problematic ."
Research method	"Based on a corpus of archived chat reference transcripts , we show what types of problems in communication are displayed in the interaction , primarily through repair initiations , whether the problems are resolved , and , if so , how ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Sources of problems that were targeted by both librarians and patrons included mistyping , typing in the wrong window , ambiguous terminology , differences in expertise between patrons and librarians , and the difficulty of giving and following instructions while not copresent ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude with implications for the training of future librarians in performing chat reference interactions .
Research method	"We explore information practices and collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement in Grant County , Washington , based on records from November 2017 to May 2019 obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights through Public Records Act ( PRA ) requests ."
Research method	"Qualitative analysis of over 8,000 pages reveals a baseline of passive and active information sharing and collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies before Washington sanctuary laws went into effect in May 2019 , a practice that needs to stop if agencies are to comply with the laws ."
Research method	"We employ a systematic methodology to obtain ( through PRA and other Access to Information requests ) and analyze official records through qualitative content analysis , to monitor and hold local law enforcement accountable in their compliance with sanctuary laws ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This method can be used to examine law enforcement information behaviors in other counties in Washington , and in other states that offer sanctuary protections , as a way to monitor compliance with sanctuary laws and strengthen the protection of immigrants ' rights ."
Research method	It uses visits to the Expert Protein Analysis System ( ExPASy ) server-a virtual research infrastructure for bioinformatics-as a proxy for measuring bioinformatic research activity .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study finds that in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , Germany , and Spain the number of visits to the ExPASy Web server made by research organizations is significantly positively correlated with research output in the field of biochemistry , molecular biology , and genetics ."
Research findings/conclusions	Only in the UK do we find a significant positive correlation between ExPASy visits per publication and the normalized impact of an organization 's publications .
Research findings/conclusions	The type of indicator developed in this study can be used to measure research activity in fields in which e-research has become important .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , it can be used for the evaluation of e-research infrastructures ."
Research questions	"Serendipity , in turn , has been touted as an antidote ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , the desirability of serendipity could vary by context , as users may be more or less receptive depending on the services they employ ."
Research method	"We propose a nomological model of online serendipity experiences , conceptualizing both cognitive and behavioral antecedents ."
Research method	"Based on a survey of 1,173 German Internet users , we conduct structural equation modeling and multigroup analyses to differentiate the antecedents and effects of serendipity across three distinct contexts : online shopping , information services , and social networking sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions confirm that antecedents and outcomes of digital serendipity vary by context , with serendipity only being associated with user satisfaction in the context of social network sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	Pre-marketing clinical trials and traditional post-marketing surveillance using voluntary and spontaneous report systems are insufficient for ADR detection .
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , online health forums provide valuable evidences in a large scale and in a timely fashion through the active participation of patients , caregivers , and doctors ."
Research questions	"In this article , we present patient-centered and experience-aware mining framework for effective ADR discovery using online health forum data ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our experimental evaluation with both an official ADR knowledge base and human-annotated ground truth verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method for ADR discovery .
Research findings/conclusions	These decisions are greatly influenced by contextual characteristics of the request .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the contextual influence may not be uniform among users with different levels of privacy concerns ."
Research questions	"In this study , we hypothesize that users with higher privacy concerns may consider contextual factors differently from those with lower privacy concerns ."
Research method	"By conducting a scenario-based survey study and structural equation modeling , we verify the interaction effects between privacy concerns and contextual factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	We additionally find that users ' perceived risk towards the requester mediates the effect of context and privacy concerns .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These results extend our understanding about the cognitive process behind privacy decision making in SNSs .
Research findings/conclusions	The interaction effects suggest strategies for SNS providers to predict user 's friend request acceptance and to customize context-aware privacy decision support based on users ' different privacy attitudes .
Research questions	"Content curation communities are large-scale crowdsourcing endeavors that aim to curate existing content into a single repository , making these communities different from content creation communities such as Wikipedia ."
Research questions	"In this article , we define content curation communities and provide examples of this increasingly important genre ."
Research method	"We then follow by presenting EOL , a compelling example of a content curation community , and describe a case study of EOL based on analysis of interviews , online discussions , and survey data ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions are characterized into two broad categories : information integration and social integration .
Research questions	"Information integration challenges at EOL include the need to ( a ) accommodate and validate multiple sources and ( b ) integrate traditional peer reviewed sources with user-generated , nonpeer-reviewed content ."
Research findings/conclusions	Social integration challenges at EOL include the need to ( a ) establish the credibility of open-access resources within the scientific community and ( b ) facilitate collaboration between experts and novices .
Research findings/conclusions	"After identifying the challenges , we discuss the potential strategies EOL and other content curation communities can use to address them , and provide technical , content , and social design recommendations for overcoming them ."
Research findings/conclusions	Government funding and spending in the higher education sector encourage publications as a long-term research benefit .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , other components such as industrial funding and spending in the business sector encourage patenting ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results help explain why the United States trails the European Union in publications : The focus in the United States is on industrial funding some 70 % of its total R & D investment .
Research findings/conclusions	"Likewise , our results also help explain why the European Union trails the United States in patenting , since its focus on government funding is less effective than industrial funding in predicting triadic patenting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Government funding contributes negatively to patenting in a multiple regression , and this relationship is significant in the case of triadic patenting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We provide new forecasts about the relationships of the United States , the European Union , and China for publishing ; these results suggest much later dates for changes than previous forecasts because Chinese growth has been slowing down since 2003 ."
Research findings/conclusions	Models for individual countries might be more successful than regression models whose parameters are averaged over a set of countries because nations can be expected to differ historically in terms of the institutional arrangements and funding schemes .
Research findings/conclusions	"This study suggests a significant contribution of citizen science to various disciplines as well as overall science education , literacy , and development ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A solid theoretical grounding of citizen science research , coupled with application of pertinent emergent theories to various processes associated with scientific inquiry and discovery , suggests the disciplinary traits and unique contributions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study proposes that the current pace of citizen science research , empowered by ordinary citizens as well as technological affordances , provides solid evidence to warrant further development of citizen science as a unique discipline that can strengthen and democratize scientific inquiry ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It concludes that individual factors are more central and fundamental , although they may certainly be qualified by social and cultural factors and even though there are good reasons for studying and analyzing information behavior in terms of social groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	More studies of interesting emergent factors and behaviors in social settings would be valuable .
Research method	"In the study we used triangulation , combining tag analysis and semistructured interviews , with production staff of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The main Research findings/conclusions reveal incomplete indexing of TV programs and their parts , in addition to low indexing consistency and uneven indexing exhaustivity ."
Research findings/conclusions	The informants expressed low motivation and a high level of uncertainty regarding the task .
Research findings/conclusions	Internal guidelines and high domain knowledge among the indexers does not form a sufficient basis for creating quality and consistency in the vocabulary .
Research findings/conclusions	"The challenges that are revealed in the terminological analysis , combined with low indexing knowledge and lack of motivation , will create difficulties in the retrieval phase ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As features , we suggest using the 200 most frequent terms of the disputed text ( isolated words and punctuation symbols ) ."
Research method	"Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors , we can determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , based on a simple rule we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer or when the attribution scheme is unable to make a decision with a high degree of certainty ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Evaluations based on 6 test collections ( PAN CLEF 2014 evaluation campaign ) indicate that SPATIUM-L1 usually appears in the top 3 best verification systems , and on an aggregate measure , presents the best performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages ( such as English , Dutch , Spanish , and Greek ) or genres ( essay , novel , review , and newspaper article ) ."
Research method	This article reports on an analysis of information sharing and use in three investment discussion forums .
Research method	"Threads containing 1,787 posts were coded using previously developed typologies for Internet-based discussion ."
Research method	Citations were studied in their context and sources were categorized into types .
Research findings/conclusions	"A high degree of collaborative information behavior was identified , but the study also reveals some areas of information use that may compromise investors ' decision making , including heavy reliance on personal sources of information and other sources that vary greatly in trustworthiness , including commercially sponsored information , blogs , and investor guru sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	These challenges are discussed and recommendations are made for improving services to investors .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Questions for additional research are also identified .
Research questions	"Current online MT services are available and affordable , but are not always effective for creating multilingual metadata records ."
Research method	"In this study , we implemented 3 different MT strategies and evaluated their performance when translating English metadata records to Chinese and Spanish ."
Research method	"These strategies included combining MT results from 3 online MT systems ( Google , Bing , and Yahoo ! )"
Research method	"with and without additional linguistic resources , such as manually-generated parallel corpora , and metadata records in the two target languages obtained from international partners ."
Research method	The open-source statistical MT platform Moses was applied to design and implement the three translation strategies .
Research findings/conclusions	Human evaluation of the MT results using adequacy and fluency demonstrated that two of the strategies produced higher quality translations than individual online MT systems for both languages .
Research findings/conclusions	"Especially , adding small , manually-generated parallel corpora of metadata records significantly improved translation performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our study suggested an effective and efficient MT approach for providing multilingual services for digital collections .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although English tends to be the dominant language of science , SSH researchers often produce culturally and societally relevant work in their local languages ."
Research method	"We collected and analyzed a set of 164,218 peer-reviewed journal articles ( produced by 51,063 researchers from 2013 to 2015 ) and found that multilingualism is prevalent despite geographical location and field ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the researchers who published at least three journal articles during this time period , over one-third from the various countries had written their work in at least two languages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The highest share of researchers who published in only one language were from Flanders ( 80.9 % ) , whereas the lowest shares were from Slovenia ( 57.2 % ) and Poland ( 59.3 % ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions show that multilingual publishing is an ongoing practice in many SSH research fields regardless of geographical location , political situation , and/or historical heritage ."
Research questions	"Here we argue that research is international , but multilingual publishing keeps locally relevant research alive with the added potential for creating impact ."
Research questions	"First we present a conceptual framework for analyzing image topicality , explicating the layers , the perspectives , and the topical relevance relationships involved in modeling the topicality of art images ."
Research method	We adapt a generic relevance typology to image analysis by extending it with definitions and relationships specific to the visual art domain and integrating it with schemes of image-text relationships that are important for image subject indexing .
Research method	We then apply the adapted typology to analyze the topical relevance relationships between 11 art images and 768 image tags assigned by art historians and librarians .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The original contribution of our work is the topical structure analysis of image tags that allows the viewer to more easily grasp the content , context , and meaning of an image and quickly tune into aspects of interest ; it could also guide both the indexer and the searcher to specify image tags/descriptors in a more systematic and precise manner and thus improve the match between the two parties ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	An additional contribution is systematically examining and integrating the variety of image-text relationships from a relevance perspective .
Research findings/conclusions	The paper concludes with implications for relational indexing and social tagging .
Research method	This model is based on expectation disconfirmation theory and insights garnered from a recent qualitative investigation of student learning outcomes from ILI given at three business schools .
Research method	The model was tested through a web survey administered to 372 students .
Research method	"The model represents psychological , behavioral , and benefit outcomes as second-order molecular constructs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results from a partial least squares ( PLS ) analysis reveal that expectation disconfirmation influences perceived quality and student satisfaction .
Research findings/conclusions	These in turn affect student psychological outcomes .
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , psychological outcomes influence student behaviors , which in turn affect benefit outcomes ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the study 's Research findings/conclusions , several recommendations are made ."
Research questions	It is already known that various user characteristics influence the way credibility evaluation is performed .
Research questions	"Domain experts on the topic at hand primarily focus on semantic features of information ( e.g. , factual accuracy ) , whereas novices focus more on surface features ( e.g. , length of a text ) ."
Research questions	"In this study , we further explore two key influences on credibility evaluation : topic familiarity and information skills ."
Research method	"Participants with varying expected levels of information skills ( i.e. , high school students , undergraduates , and postgraduates ) evaluated Wikipedia articles of varying quality on familiar and unfamiliar topics while thinking aloud ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When familiar with the topic , participants indeed focused primarily on semantic features of the information , whereas participants unfamiliar with the topic paid more attention to surface features ."
Research findings/conclusions	The utilization of surface features increased with information skills .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , participants with better information skills calibrated their trust against the quality of the information , whereas trust of participants with poorer information skills did not ."
Research findings/conclusions	This study confirms the enabling character of domain expertise and information skills in credibility evaluation as predicted by the updated 3S-model of credibility evaluation .
Research findings/conclusions	These methods are all limited by an inability to perform open-set classification and account for text and corpus size .
Research method	We propose a customized Bayesian logit-normal-beta-binomial classification model for supervised authorship attribution .
Research method	The model is based on the beta-binomial distribution with an explicit inverse relationship between extra-binomial variation and text size .
Research method	"The model internally estimates the relationship of extra-binomial variation to text size , and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) to produce distributions of posterior authorship probabilities instead of point estimates ."
Research method	"We illustrate the method by training the machine-learning methods as well as the open-set Bayesian classifier on undisputed papers of The Federalist , and testing the method on documents historically attributed to Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , and James Madison ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Bayesian classifier was the best classifier of these texts .
Research questions	We study whether Mendeley readership scores ( RS ) can identify highly cited publications more effectively than journal citation scores ( JCS ) .
Research method	Web of Science ( WoS ) publications with digital object identifiers ( DOIs ) published during the period 2004-2013 and across five major scientific fields were analyzed .
Research findings/conclusions	The main result of this study shows that RS are more effective ( in terms of precision/recall values ) than JCS to identify highly cited publications across all fields of science and publication years .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions also show that 86.5 % of all the publications are covered by Mendeley and have at least one reader .
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , the share of publications with Mendeley RS is increasing from 84 % in 2004 to 89 % in 2009 , and decreasing from 88 % in 2010 to 82 % in 2013 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , it is noted that publications from 2010 onwards exhibit on average a higher density of readership versus citation scores ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This indicates that compared to citation scores , RS are more prevalent for recent publications and hence they could work as an early indicator of research impact ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions highlight the potential and value of Mendeley as a tool for scientometric Research questionss and particularly as a relevant tool to identify highly cited publications .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Several studies have recently discussed the stability of word embeddings in general domain and suggested factors influencing the stability .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this work , we conduct a detailed analysis on the stability of concept embeddings in medical domain , particularly in relations with concept frequency ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis reveals the surprising high stability of low-frequency concepts : low-frequency ( < 100 ) concepts have the same high stability as high-frequency ( > 1,000 ) concepts ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To develop a deeper understanding of this finding , we propose a new factor , the noisiness of context words , which influences the stability of medical concept embeddings regardless of high or low frequency ."
Research method	We evaluate the proposed factor by showing the linear correlation with the stability of medical concept embeddings .
Research findings/conclusions	The correlations are clear and consistent with various groups of medical concepts .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the linear relations , we make suggestions on ways to adjust the noisiness of context words for the improvement of stability ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we demonstrate that the linear relation of the proposed factor extends to the word embedding stability in general domain ."
Research method	Cosine distance is chosen to measure the similarities among the six networks .
Research findings/conclusions	The authors found that topical networks and coauthorship networks have the lowest similarity ; cocitation networks and citation networks have high similarity ; bibliographic coupling networks and cocitation networks have high similarity ; and coword networks and topical networks have high similarity .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , through multidimensional scaling , two dimensions can be identified among the six networks : Dimension 1 can be interpreted as citation-based versus noncitation-based , and Dimension 2 can be interpreted as social versus cognitive ."
Research findings/conclusions	The authors recommend the use of hybrid or heterogeneous networks to study research interaction and scholarly communications .
Research questions	This paper examines some of the key challenges facing mHealth with a focus on privacy and security issues .
Research findings/conclusions	"In the first part of the paper , the security engineering process is described , which can assist healthcare organizations in developing an architecture-level protection strategy that is compliant with privacy and security legislation and industry initiatives ."
Research method	"In the second part of the paper , use cases are selected to illustrate the diverse security architecture contexts in which the protection strategy will be deployed , and to emphasize the importance of integrating security across these contexts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the third part of the paper , industry and government security best practices are discussed , which can assist healthcare organizations in implementing security architectures to meet their specific privacy and security requirements ."
Research findings/conclusions	These clubs typically rely on volunteers who use Internet platforms ( such as websites and social media ) to support their roles .
Research findings/conclusions	"Use of the Internet can assist these volunteers by facilitating improved information access , communication , and efficiency ."
Research questions	Little is known about how local sporting clubs use this important information systems ' function .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study extends Burgess ' ( 2016 ) web presence pyramid model to examine factors leading to differences in Internet use by athletics and cricket clubs in the United Kingdom and Australia .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions suggest that higher adoption levels of websites set up by clubs and social media and more sophisticated Internet usage are apparent in upper level ( or well-resourced ) local clubs than in lower level clubs , but with some important variations ( such as interventions by sport governing bodies ) that may assist smaller clubs to adopt online platforms ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Guidance on using the extended model in other contexts is offered , as is advice for clubs and sporting associations looking to improve their use of Internet platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	We believe it is necessary to use different answering strategies based on the type of questions to accommodate the different information needs .
Research questions	"In this research , we propose the ASK taxonomy that categorizes questions posted on social networking sites into three types according to the nature of the questioner 's inquiry of accuracy , social , or knowledge ."
Research method	"To automatically decide which answering strategy to use , we develop a predictive model based on ASK question types using question features from the perspectives of lexical , topical , contextual , and syntactic as well as answer features ."
Research method	"By applying the classifier on an annotated data set , we present a comprehensive analysis to compare questions in terms of their word usage , topical interests , temporal and spatial restrictions , syntactic structure , and response characteristics ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our research results show that the three types of questions exhibited different characteristics in the way they are asked .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our automatic classification algorithm achieves an 83 % correct labeling result , showing the value of the ASK taxonomy for the design of social question and answering systems ."
Research questions	"and how best to model the vocabulary signal , and ( c ) how large is the gap between supervised and unsupervised methods and what are the practical consequences ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our best results on the RepLab dataset ( which improves the state of the art ) uses language models to learn the domain-specific vocabulary used by influencers and combines domain and authority models using a Learning to Rank algorithm .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our experiments show that ( a ) both authority and domain evidence can be trained from the vocabulary of influencers ; ( b ) once the language of influencers is modeled as a likelihood signal , further supervised learning and additional network-based signals only provide marginal improvements ; and ( c ) the availability of training data sets is crucial to obtain competitive results in the task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our most remarkable finding is that influencers do use a distinctive vocabulary , which is a more reliable signal than nontextual network indicators such as the number of followers , retweets , and so on ."
Research method	"By linking recommendations for 28,254 publications in F1000 with citations in Scopus , we investigated the effect of research level ( basic , clinical , mixed ) and article type on the internal consistency of assessments based on citations and FFa scores ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The research level has little impact on the differences between the 2 evaluation tools , while article type has a big effect ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These 2 measures differ significantly for 2 groups : ( a ) nonprimary research or evidence-based research are more highly cited but not highly recommended , while ( b ) translational research or transformative research are more highly recommended but have fewer citations ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This can be expected , since citation activity is usually practiced by academic authors while the potential for scientific revolutions and the suitability for clinical practice of an article should be investigated from a practitioners ' perspective ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude with a recommendation that the application of bibliometric approaches in research evaluation should consider the proportion of 3 types of publications : evidence-based research , transformative research , and translational research ."
Research findings/conclusions	The latter 2 types are more suitable for assessment through peer review .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research analyzes funding acknowledgment presence in scientific publications and introduces a novel approach for discovering text patterns by discipline in the acknowledgment section of papers .
Research method	"First , the presence of acknowledgments in 38,257 English-language papers published by Spanish researchers in 2010 is studied by subject area on the basis of the funding acknowledgment information available in the Web of Science database ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Funding acknowledgments are present in two thirds of Spanish articles , with significant differences by subject area , number of authors , impact factor of journals , and , in one specific area , basic/applied nature of research ."
Research method	"Second , the existence of specific acknowledgment patterns in English-language papers of Spanish researchers in 4 selected subject categories ( cardiac and cardiovascular systems , economics , evolutionary biology , and statistics and probability ) is explored through a combination of text mining and multivariate analyses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Peer interactive communication predominates in the more theoretical or social-oriented fields ( statistics and probability , economics ) , whereas the recognition of technical assistance is more common in experimental research ( evolutionary biology ) , and the mention of potential conflicts of interest emerges forcefully in the clinical field ( cardiac and cardiovascular systems ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The systematic inclusion of structured data about acknowledgments in journal articles and bibliographic databases would have a positive impact on the study of collaboration practices in science .
Research findings/conclusions	"It has also been recognized that geography is an important criterion of relevance , leading to the research area of geographic information retrieval ."
Research questions	"As users increasingly retrieve information in mobile situations , relevance is often related to geographic features in the real world as well as their representation in web documents ."
Research method	"We present 2 methods for assessing geographic relevance ( GR ) of geographic entities in a mobile use context that include the 5 criteria topicality , spatiotem-poral proximity , directionality , cluster , and colocation ."
Research method	"To determine the effectiveness and validity of these methods , we evaluate them through a user study conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An analysis of relevance ranks for geographic entities in 3 scenarios produced by two GR methods , 2 baseline methods , and human judgments collected in the experiment reveal that one of the GR methods produces similar ranks as human assessors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We present a large-scale validation study of this universality-of-citation-distributions claim .
Research findings/conclusions	Our analysis shows that claiming citation distributions to be universal for all fields of science is not warranted .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although many fields indeed seem to have fairly similar citation distributions , there are exceptions as well ."
Research questions	We also briefly discuss the consequences of our Research findings/conclusions for the measurement of scientific impact using citation-based bibliometric indicators .
Research findings/conclusions	It is shown that in this way uncertainties and ambiguities in the evaluation of specific quantile values and percentile ranks do not occur .
Research method	Using the fractional scoring the total score of all papers exactly reproduces the theoretical value .
Research questions	"The focus of this work is on the basic structural nature of a thesaurus itself , not on how people develop a thesaurus or how a thesaurus effects retrieval performance ."
Research method	Thesauri in this research are automatically developed in a simulation from sets of randomly or exhaustively generated documents .
Research method	"Each thesaurus is generated by the Thesaurus Generator software from a set of several hundred documents , and thousands of different document sets are used as input to the Thesaurus Generator , producing thousands of thesauri ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , thousands of thesauri are generated for each data point in accompanying graphs ."
Research method	The characteristics of this large number of thesauri are studied so that the relationships between thesaurus parameters can be determined .
Research findings/conclusions	"Some rules governing these relationships are suggested , addressing factors such as tree height and width , number of tree roots in thesauri , and number of terms available for the vocabulary ."
Research questions	How these parameters scale as vocabularies grow is addressed .
Research findings/conclusions	"These results apply to various information systems that contain features with hierarchical relationships , including many thesauri and ontologies ."
Research method	Answers .
Research method	"The dataset comprises 3.9 million questions and these questions are organized into more than 1,000 categories in a hierarchy ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To the best knowledge , this is the first systematic evaluation of the performance of different classification methods on question topic classification as well as short texts ."
Research method	"Specifically , we empirically evaluate the following in classifying questions into CQA categories : ( a ) the usefulness of n-gram features and bag-of-word features ; ( b ) the performance of three standard classification algorithms ( naive Bayes , maximum entropy , and support vector machines ) ; ( c ) the performance of the state-of-the-art hierarchical classification algorithms ; ( d ) the effect of training data size on performance ; and ( e ) the effectiveness of the different components of CQA data , including subject , content , asker , and the best answer ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show what aspects are important for question topic classification in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency .
Research findings/conclusions	We believe that the experimental Research findings/conclusions from this study will be useful in real-world classification problems .
Research questions	One such problem is aboutness : How do texts relate to the world ?
Research questions	"In response to this problem , philosophers of history have developed theories of colligation describing how authors bind together phenomena under organizing concepts ."
Research questions	"Drawing on these ideas , I present a theory of subject analysis that avoids the problematic illusion of an independent landscape of subjects ."
Research findings/conclusions	This theory points to a broad vision of the future of information organization and some specific challenges to be met .
Research questions	"Although researchers have attempted to explain the effect of SNS use on users ' psychological well-being , previous studies have produced inconsistent results ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , most previous studies relied on healthy students as participants ; other cohorts of SNSs users , in particular people living with serious health conditions , have been neglected ."
Research method	"In this study , we carried out semistructured interviews with users of the Ovarian Cancer Australia ( OCA ) Facebook to assess how and in what ways SNS use impacts their psychological well-being ."
Research method	A theoretical model was proposed to develop a better understanding of the relationships between SNS use and the psychological well-being of cancer patients .
Research findings/conclusions	Analysis of data collected through a subsequent quantitative survey confirmed the theoretical model and empirically revealed the extent to which SNS use impacts the psychological well-being of cancer patients .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions showed the use of OCA Facebook enhances social support , enriches the experience of social connectedness , develops social presence and learning and ultimately improves the psychological well-being of cancer patients ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Current research and commercial efforts have concentrated on sensor-based collection of health data for personal fitness and healthcare feedback Research questionss .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , to date there has not been a detailed investigation of how such smartphones and sensors can be utilized for public health data collection Research questionss ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Public health data have the characteristic of being capturable while still not infringing upon privacy , as the full detailed data of individuals are not needed but rather only anonymized , aggregate , de-identified , and non-unique data for an individual ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , rather than details of physical activity including specific route , just total caloric burn over a week or month could be submitted , thereby strongly assisting non-re-identification ."
Research questions	"In this paper we introduce , prototype , and evaluate a new type of public health information system to provide aggregate population health data capture and public health intervention capabilities via utilizing smartphone and sensor capabilities , while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual ."
Research questions	"We consider in particular the key aspects of privacy , anonymity , and intervention capabilities of these emerging systems and provide a detailed evaluation of anonymity preservation characteristics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For peer-reviewed journal articles , there are two main routes to OA : publishing in OA journals ( gold OA ) or archiving of article copies or manuscripts at other web locations ( green OA ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study focuses on summarizing and extending current knowledge about green OA .
Research findings/conclusions	"A synthesis of previous studies indicates that green OA coverage of all published journal articles is approximately 12 % , with substantial disciplinary variation ."
Research questions	"Typically , green OA copies become available after considerable time delays , partly caused by publisher-imposed embargo periods , and partly by author tendencies to archive manuscripts only periodically ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although green OA copies should ideally be archived in proper repositories , a large share is stored on home pages and similar locations , with no assurance of long-term preservation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Often such locations contain exact copies of published articles , which may infringe on the publisher 's exclusive rights ."
Research questions	The technical foundation for green OA uploading is becoming increasingly solid largely due to the rapid increase in the number of institutional repositories .
Research findings/conclusions	"The number of articles within the scope of OA mandates , which strongly influence the self-archival rate of articles , is nevertheless still low ."
Research method	The researchers gathered interview data from 24 mothers .
Research method	Resulting data were inductively analyzed using Chatman 's ( 1996 ) theory of information poverty .
Research findings/conclusions	We propose information marginalization as a complimentary concept to describe the contextual conditions that contribute to a range of defensive information behaviors and suggest that assessment of these contextual conditions be a part of the system design process .
Research findings/conclusions	This study has implications for the development and design of systems and service models intended to provide access to information and services for individuals with disability and contributes to a critical literature on information poverty .
Research questions	"Owned by LinkedIn since 2012 , it targets a professional audience but may give value to scholarship through creating a long-term record of the content of talks ."
Research method	This article tests this hypothesis by analyzing sets of general and scholarly related SlideShare documents using content and citation analysis and popularity statistics reported on the site .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that academics , students , and teachers are a minority of SlideShare uploaders , especially since 2010 , with most documents not being directly related to scholarship or teaching ."
Research findings/conclusions	"About two thirds of uploaded SlideShare documents are presentation slides , with the remainder often being files associated with presentations or video recordings of talks ."
Research findings/conclusions	SlideShare is therefore a presentation-centered site with a predominantly professional user base .
Research findings/conclusions	"Although a minority of the uploaded SlideShare documents are cited by , or cite , academic publications , probably too few articles are cited by SlideShare to consider extracting SlideShare citations for research evaluation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Nevertheless , scholars should consider SlideShare to be a potential source of academic and nonacademic information , particularly in library and information science , education , and business ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Research and scholarship in this area has accelerated since the coining and subsequent advocacy for altmetrics-that is , research indicators based on social media activity ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This review provides an extensive account of the state-of-the art in both scholarly use of social media and altmetrics .
Research method	"The review consists of 2 main parts : the first examines the use of social media in academia , reviewing the various functions these platforms have in the scholarly communication process and the factors that affect this use ."
Research method	"The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics , discussing the various interpretations of altmetrics , data collection and methodological limitations , and differences according to platform ."
Research questions	The review ends with a critical discussion of the implications of this transformation in the scholarly communication system .
Research findings/conclusions	"Files can be shared either using Group Information Management ( GIM ) , where collaborators exploit a common repository ( e.g. , the cloud ) , or Personal Information Management ( PIM ) , where files are sent via email attachments , and collaborators store files individually in personal collections ."
Research questions	"Given the recent prevalence of GIM , we compare the effects on retrieval for PIM versus GIM collections ."
Research questions	"We examine the effects of various theoretically motivated factors relating to collection size , properties of the target file , and user workload ."
Research method	"In our study , 289 participants accessed 1,557 of their own shared files in a naturalistic setting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results indicate that factors relating to collection size , file versions , and user workload negatively affect the retrieval of GIM more than PIM files , indicating that PIM is morescalablethan GIM ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Testing a very different population , we confirm previous Research findings/conclusions that failure percentages of GIM are approximately double those of PIM ."
Research questions	"We discuss possible theoretical explanations , specifically how factors that hinder retrieval exacerbate the general GIM problem of retrieving files organized by other people ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , PIM 's greater scalability has practical implications for fast-growing organizations such as startups when choosing their sharing policies ."
Research questions	"Most recently , Ke , Ferrara , Radicchi , and Flammini ( 2015 , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA , 112 ( 24 ) , 7426-7431 ) proposed the so called beauty coefficient ( denoted as B ) to quantify how much a given paper can be considered as a paper with delayed recognition ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this study , the new term smart girl ( SG ) is suggested to differentiate instant credit or flashes in the pan from SBs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Although SG and SB are qualitatively defined , the dynamic citation angle beta is introduced in this study as a simple way for identifying SGs and SBs quantitatively - complementing the beauty coefficient B ."
Research method	"The citation angles for all articles from 1980 ( n=166,870 ) in natural sciences are calculated for identifying SGs and SBs and their extent ."
Research findings/conclusions	We reveal that about 3 % of the articles are typical SGs and about 0.1 % typical SBs .
Research method	The potential advantages of the citation angle approach are explained .
Research method	"For research on the value of information , Saracevic and Kantor ( 1997 ) proposed a framework from a value perspective in philosophy ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In this report , we substantiate the framework with an updated review of the literature and demonstrate its applicability to understanding the value of user feedback as one type of information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our field study , in the setting of a health information provider whose information products serve thousands of Canadian healthcare professionals , provides an example of how this value-of-information framework can be operationalized for an organization ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition to the theoretical and methodological contributions , this research adds to the literature by documenting the way that textual feedback data were used to optimize the content of an information resource ."
Research findings/conclusions	This contrasts with published studies that only dealt with the use of quantitative feedback by information providers not involved in content production .
Research findings/conclusions	"Reading occurs before citing , however , and so it makes sense to count readers rather than citations for recent publications ."
Research method	"To assess this , Mendeley readers and citations were obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories ( agriculture , business , decision science , pharmacy , and the social sciences ) and 50 subcategories ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In these areas , citation counts tended to increase with every extra year since publication , and readership counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after about 5 years ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The correlation between citations and readers was also higher for longer time periods , stabilizing after about 5 years ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and smaller differences between subfields , the results confirm the value of Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study takes a rhetorical history approach to better understand the development of information studies as a discipline .
Research questions	Information studies historians have identified that the Cold War period was critical for the development of information science and consequently of its modern-day incarnations .
Research questions	"Due to post-World War II prosperity , the 1960s saw a surge in interest in scientific and technical information ."
Research questions	"Many from government , education , and private sectors took interest in developing new ways to compete with Soviet science ."
Research method	"This interest led to the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) -funded Georgia Tech conferences of 1961 and 1962 , which are analyzed here ."
Research findings/conclusions	I find that concerns about the science information problem provided language that was critical for transforming some of the information studies ' central concepts .
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , I find that the idea of an information scientist was made possible by national funding for science information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	I suggest that attending to the discursive traffic between public and disciplinary discourse of information studies can better attune the field to its intellectual commitments .
Research findings/conclusions	It is evident that KMS technologies and activities are indiscriminately deployed in most organizations with little regard to the actual context of their adoption .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , it is apparent that the extant literature pertaining to knowledge management projects is frequently deficient in identifying the variety of factors indicative for successful KMS ."
Research findings/conclusions	This presents an obvious business practice and research gap that requires a critical analysis of the necessary intervention that will actually improve how workers can leverage and form organization-wide knowledge .
Research method	"This research involved an extensive review of the literature , a grounded theory methodological approach and rigorous data collection and synthesis through an empirical case analysis ( Parsons Brinckerhoff and Samsung ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The contribution of this study is the formulation of a model for designing KMS based upon the design science paradigm , which aspires to create artifacts that are interdependent of people and organizations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The essential proposition is that KMS design and implementation must be contextualized in relation to knowledge needs and that these will differ for various organizational settings .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions present valuable insights and further understanding of the way in which KMS design efforts should be focused .
Research method	"One hundred and four individuals participated in the study , with 76 completing the diaries ."
Research findings/conclusions	Individuals were most likely to lie on the telephone .
Research findings/conclusions	"Planned lies , which participants also rated the most serious , were more likely told via SMS ( short message service ) text messaging ."
Research findings/conclusions	Most lies were told to people participants felt closest to .
Research findings/conclusions	The feature-based model provides a better account of the deceptions reported by participants than do media richness theory or social distance theory .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the authors propose a reworked feature-based model to explain deception across different media ."
Research findings/conclusions	They suggest that instant messaging should be treated as a near synchronous mode of communication .
Research findings/conclusions	We suggest that the model needs to distinguish between spontaneous and planned lies .
Research findings/conclusions	"These applications enable communication between people , using features such as chatting and blogging ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"There is , however , little consideration of the collaboration between people during information seeking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Mobile applications should support the seeking , sharing , confirming , and validating of information systematically to help users complete their tasks and fulfill their information needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To support information seeking , especially collaboratively as a group , there is a need to understand people 's social interaction behavior ."
Research method	"Using tourism as a domain , we conducted a diary study to look into tourists ' social interaction during information seeking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further , based on the diary study Research findings/conclusions and current research , we describe a set of triggers that lead to collaboration for each step in the information-seeking process ."
Research questions	Here we present the social collaboration patterns between tourists and the people around them .
Research method	"Further , based on a diary study and current research , we describe a set of triggers that lead to collaboration for each step in the BIG6 information-seeking process ."
Research questions	"In information retrieval ( IR ) , some studies have examined the validity and suitability of such tests for comparing search systems ."
Research questions	"We argue here that current methods for assessing the reliability of statistical tests suffer from some methodological weaknesses , and we propose a novel way to study significance tests for retrieval evaluation ."
Research method	"Using Score Distributions , we model the output of multiple search systems , produce simulated search results from such models , and compare them using various significance tests ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	A key strength of this approach is that we assess statistical tests under perfect knowledge about the truth or falseness of the null hypothesis .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This new method for studying the power of significance tests in IR evaluation is formal and innovative .
Research findings/conclusions	"Following this type of analysis , we found that both the sign test and Wilcoxon signed test have more power than the permutation test and the t-test ."
Research findings/conclusions	The sign test and Wilcoxon signed test also have good behavior in terms of type I errors .
Research findings/conclusions	"The bootstrap test shows few type I errors , but it has less power than the other methods tested ."
Research questions	"In this case study , we examine how different generations of information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) , ranging from e-mail to micro-blogging , can help address these challenges ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Twenty-one interviews with employees from a multinational company revealed that although people think social media can better address these challenges than older tools , the full potential of social media for supporting knowledge sharing has yet to be achieved ."
Research questions	"When examining the interconnections among different ICTs , we found that employees choice of a combination of ICTs , as affected by their functional backgrounds , could create technological divides among them and separate resources ."
Research findings/conclusions	This finding indicates that having more ICTs is not necessarily better .
Research findings/conclusions	"ICT integration , as well as support for easy navigation , is crucial for effective knowledge search and sharing ."
Research findings/conclusions	Adaptation to local culture is also needed to ensure worldwide participation in knowledge sharing .
Research method	"We used a theoretical conception of metaphor from cognitive linguistics to design an interactive system for viewing the citation network of the corpora of literature in the JSTOR database , a highly connected compound graph of 2 million papers linked by 8 million citations ."
Research method	"We created 4 variants of this system , manipulating 2 distinct properties of metaphor ."
Research method	We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with 80 participants to compare understanding and engagement when working with each version .
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that building on known image schemas improved response time on look-up tasks , while contextual detail predicted increases in persistence and the number of inferences drawn from the data ."
Research findings/conclusions	Schema-congruency combined with contextual detail produced the highest gains in comprehension .
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions provide concrete mechanisms by which designers presenting large data sets through metaphorical interfaces may improve their effectiveness and appeal with users .
Research questions	"Even though in recent years online Q & A has considerably grown in popularity and impacted information-seeking behaviors , we still lack knowledge about what motivates people to ask a question in online Q & A environments ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Yahoo !
Research method	"Answers and WikiAnswers were selected as the test beds in the study , and a sequential mixed method employing an Internet-based survey , a diary method , and interviews was used to investigate user motivations for asking a question in online Q & A services ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Cognitive needs were found as the most significant motivation , driving people to ask a question ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , it was found that other motivational factors ( e.g. , tension free needs ) also played an important role in user motivations for asking a question , depending on asker 's contexts and situations ."
Research findings/conclusions	Understanding motivations for asking a question could provide a general framework of conceptualizing different contexts and situations of information needs in online Q & A .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions have several implications not only for developing better question-answering processes in online Q & A environments , but also for gaining insights into the broader understanding of online information-seeking behaviors ."
Research questions	Applying topic models to short text documents to extract meaningful topics is challenging .
Research findings/conclusions	The problem becomes even more complicated when dealing with short and noisy micro-posts in Twitter that are about one general topic .
Research questions	"In such a case , the goal of applying topic models is to extract subtopics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This results in topics represented by similar sets of keywords , which in turn makes the process of topic interpretation more confusing ."
Research method	"In this paper we propose a new method that incorporates Twitter-LDA , WordNet , and hashtags to enhance the keyword labels that represent each topic ."
Research findings/conclusions	We emphasize the importance of different keywords to different topics based on the semantic relationships and the co-occurrences of keywords in hashtags .
Research questions	We also propose a method to find the best number of topics to represent the text document collection .
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments on two real-life Twitter datasets on fashion suggest that our method performs better than the original Twitter-LDA in terms of perplexity , topic coherence , and the quality of keywords for topic labeling ."
Research questions	"In the past two decades or so , PIR has received extensive attention in both academia and industry ."
Research questions	"This article surveys the literature of personalization in text retrieval , following a framework for aspects or factors that can be used for personalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The framework consists of additional information about users that can be explicitly obtained by asking users for their preferences , or implicitly inferred from users ' search behaviors ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Users ' characteristics and contextual factors such as tasks , time , location , etc. , can be helpful for personalization ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This article also addresses various issues including when to personalize , the evaluation of PIR , privacy , usability , etc ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the extensive review , challenges are discussed and directions for future effort are suggested ."
Research questions	"What might poetic features , such as syllabic stress and mood , contribute ?"
Research method	We address this question in the context of two different attribution problems : ( a ) kindred : differentiate Langston Hughes early poems from those of kindred poets and ( b ) diachronic : differentiate Hughes early from his later poems .
Research method	"Using a diverse set of 535 generic text features , each categorized as poetic or nonpoetic , correlation-based greedy forward search ranked the features and a support vector machine classified the poems ."
Research findings/conclusions	A small subset of features ( similar to 10 ) achieved cross-validated precision and recall as high as 87 % .
Research findings/conclusions	"Poetic features ( rhyme patterns particularly ) were nearly as effective as nonpoetic in kindred discrimination , but less effective diachronically ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In other words , Hughes used both poetic and nonpoetic features in distinctive ways and his use of nonpoetic features evolved systematically while he continued to experiment with poetic features ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions affirm qualitative studies attesting to structural elements from Black oral tradition and Black folk music ( blues ) and to the internal consistency of Hughes early poetry .
Research method	"The impact of user , task , and environmental factors on user satisfaction and task performance was investigated through a mixed methods study with 26 experienced information professionals using enterprise search in an oil and gas enterprise ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Some participants found 75 % of high-value items , others found none , with an average of 27 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"No association was found between self-reported search expertise and task performance , with a tendency for many participants to overestimate their search expertise ."
Research findings/conclusions	Successful searchers may have more accurate mental models of both search systems and the information space .
Research findings/conclusions	"Organizations may not have effective exploratory search task performance feedback loops , a lack of learning ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This may be caused by management bias towards technology , not capability , a lack of systems thinking ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , organizations may not know they do n't know their true level of search expertise , a lack of knowing ."
Research method	A metamodel is presented identifying the causal factors for workplace exploratory search task performance .
Research findings/conclusions	"Semistructured qualitative interviews with search staff from the defense , pharmaceutical , and aerospace sectors indicates the potential transferability of the finding that organizations may not know their search expertise levels ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Work on interactive information behaviors has also focused on organizations and on collaboration rather than conflict .
Research questions	"Therefore , in families managing chronic illness , we investigated information behaviors in the context of health-related social control and the impact of control on patient health behavior ."
Research method	We conducted a qualitative analysis of interviews with 38 family groups and 97 individuals over 2 years .
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions revealed conflictual information behavior , which led to competitions for control and influence between family members and patients ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In response to perceived patient health behavior-related problems , family members sought , shared , and used information for social control of patients by enforcing norms , leveraging expertise , performing surveillance , and structuring the environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	These behaviors clashed with patients ' interests and perspectives drawn from their own information acquisition .
Research findings/conclusions	"Patients responded by assessing family-presented information and using information to resist or appease norm enforcement , refute or agree with expertise , and permit or block surveillance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Over time , some patient behaviors changed ; alternatively , patients blocked family access to information about themselves , or family members retreated ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The results challenge presumptions of benefit and harmony that have characterized much prior information behavior research .
Research findings/conclusions	"Many other compounds that involve information seem , however , not to have a known origin yet ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , further information about the phrase information storage and retrieval is provided ."
Research findings/conclusions	Knowing the history of terms and their associated concepts is an important prescription against poor terminological phrasing and theoretical confusion .
Research questions	"EIM describes the ways that individuals , based on their beliefs , attitudes , and expectations , orient themselves to information as a resource of everyday action ."
Research findings/conclusions	The key features of EIM were identified by conceptual analysis focusing on three EIM frameworks .
Research findings/conclusions	"Four modes of EIM-Proactive , Social , Reactive , and Passive-and their 12 constituents were identified ."
Research method	A survey of 39 items was developed in two pilot studies to operationalize the identified modes as measurable EIM constituents .
Research method	The respondents in the main study were upper secondary school students ( n =412 ) .
Research method	Exploratory factor analysis ( EFA ) was applied to validate subscales for each EIM constituent .
Research findings/conclusions	"Seven subscales emerged : Inquiring and Scanning in the Proactive mode , Social media-centered , and Experiential in the Social mode , and Information poor , Overwhelmed , and Blunting in the Passive mode ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Two constituents , Serendipitous and Intuitive , were not supported in the EFA ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions highlight that the core constituents of an individual 's everyday information mastering can be operationalized as psychometric scales .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The instrument contributes to the systematic empirical study of EIM constituents and their relationships .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study further sheds light on key modes of EIM .
Research method	"In this article we propose an approach based on a beam search algorithm and a language model working at the byte/character level , the latter component implemented either as an n-gram model or a recurrent neural network ."
Research method	"The resulting system analyzes the text input with no word boundaries one token at a time , which can be a character or a byte , and uses the information gathered by the language model to determine if a boundary must be placed in the current position or not ."
Research questions	Our aim is to use this system in a preprocessing step for a microtext normalization system .
Research findings/conclusions	This means that it needs to effectively cope with the data sparsity present on this kind of texts .
Research questions	"We also strove to surpass the performance of two readily available word segmentation systems : The well-known and accessible Word Breaker by Microsoft , and the Python module WordSegment by Grant Jenks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that we have met our objectives , and we hope to continue to improve both the precision and the efficiency of our system in the future ."
Research questions	User-generated content ( UGC ) in social media can provide an invaluable source of culturally diverse viewpoints for supporting the understanding of cultural variations .
Research questions	"However , discovering and organizing UGC is notoriously challenging and laborious for humans , especially in ill-defined domains such as culture ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This calls for computational approaches to automate the UGC sensemaking process by using tagging , linking , and exploring ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Semantic technologies allow automated structuring and qualitative analysis of UGC , but are dependent on the availability of an ontology representing the main concepts in a specific domain ."
Research questions	"For the domain of cultural variations in interpersonal communication , no ontological model exists ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper presents the first such ontological model , called AMOn+ , which defines cultural variations and enables tagging culture-related mentions in textual content ."
Research method	AMOn+ is designed based on a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines theoretical models of culture with crowdsourced knowledge ( DBpedia ) .
Research findings/conclusions	An evaluation of AMOn+ demonstrated its fitness-for-Research questions regarding domain coverage for annotating culture-related concepts mentioned in text corpora .
Research findings/conclusions	This ontology can underpin computational models for making sense of UGC .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , although some of the most widespread uses of these networks nowadays are for professional , academic , and business Research questionss , a thorough investigation of professional information disclosure is still needed ."
Research questions	"This study 's primary aim , therefore , is to conduct a systematic and comprehensive investigation into patterns of professional information disclosure and various factors involved on different types of social networks ."
Research method	"To this end , a user survey was conducted ."
Research method	"We focused specifically on Facebook and LinkedIn , the 2 diverse networks most widely used in Israel ."
Research findings/conclusions	Significant differences were found between these networks .
Research findings/conclusions	"For example , we found that on Facebook professional pride is a factor in professional information disclosure , whereas on LinkedIn , work seniority and income have a significant effect ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , our Research findings/conclusions shed light on the attitudes and professional behavior of network members , leading to recommendations regarding advertising strategies and network-appropriate self-presentation , as well as approaches that companies might adopt according to the type of manpower required ."
Research questions	This prompts two questions : What precisely is the data reuse process ?
Research method	What is the connection between each participating element ?
Research method	"To address these issues , 42 studies were reviewed to identify the stages and primary data reuse elements ."
Research method	"A meta-synthesis was used to locate and analyze the studies , and inductive coding was used to organize the analytical process ."
Research method	"We identified three stages of data reuse-initiation , exploration and collection , and repurposing-and explored how they interact and form iterative characteristics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results illuminated the data reuse at each stage , including issues of data trust , data sources , scaffolds , and barriers ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results indicated that multisource data and human scaffolds promote reuse behavior effectively .
Research method	"Further , two data and information search patterns were extracted : reticular centripetal patterns and decentralized centripetal patterns ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Three paths with elements cooperating through flexible functions and motivated by different action items were identified : data centers , human scaffolds , and publications ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study supports improvements for data infrastructure construction , data reuse , and data reuse research by providing a new perspective on the effect of information behavior and clarifying the stages and contextual relationships between various elements ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In disciplinary literatures , authors indicate motivations to use the methods include needs to ( a ) translate research-based knowledge to inform practice and policy decisions , and ( b ) integrate relatively large and diverse knowledge bases to increase the generality of results and yield novel insights or explanations ."
Research method	This review presents two histories of the diffusion of research synthesis methods : a narrative history based primarily in the health and social sciences ; and a bibliometric overview across science broadly .
Research findings/conclusions	"Engagement with research synthesis was strongly correlated with evidence-based practice ( EBP ) , and moderately with review prevalence ."
Research findings/conclusions	The social sciences were most diverse in terms of when research synthesis was adopted .
Research findings/conclusions	"Technology , physical sciences , and math appear to be relatively resistant though fields such as physics may be considered to have used similar methods long ago ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Additional research is needed to assess the consequences of adoption within fields , including changes in how researchers engage with knowledge resources ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This review demonstrates that particularistic histories of science and technology may be fruitfully augmented with informetrics to examine how disciplinary diffusion narratives coincide with patterns across science more broadly , thereby opening up disciplinary knowledge to inform future research ."
Research questions	We postulate that individual users of social Q & A constantly adjust their kindness in the direction of the observed benefit and effort of others .
Research findings/conclusions	Collective reciprocity emerges from this pattern of conditional strategy of reciprocation and helps form a structure that guides the very interactions that give birth to the structure .
Research method	Based on a large sample of data from Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	"Answers , our empirical analysis supports the collective reciprocity premise , showing that the more effort ( relative to benefit ) an asker contributes to the community , the more likely the community will return the favor ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , the more benefit ( relative to effort ) the asker takes from the community , the less likely the community will cooperate in terms of providing answers ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that a structuration view of reciprocity sheds light on the duality of social norms in online communities .
Research method	The research included all major national media and political parties in Spain .
Research method	Inlink and co-link data about these organizations were collected and analyzed using multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) and other statistical methods .
Research method	"In the MDS map , media are clustered based on their political orientation ."
Research findings/conclusions	There are significantly more co-links between media and parties with the same political orientation than there are between those with different political orientations .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions from the study suggest the potential of using link analysis to gain new insights into the interactions among media and political parties .
Research questions	"IA is acknowledged as an important meta-discipline concerned with the design , implementation , and maintenance of digital information spaces ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Despite the relevance of IA , there is little research about the subject within LIS , and still less if one considers initiatives for creating a theory for IA ."
Research questions	"In this article , we provide a theory for IA and describe the resources needed to create it through ontological models ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We also choose the document as the key entity for such theory , contemplating kinds of documents that not only serve to register information , but also create claims and obligations in society ."
Research method	"To achieve our goals , we provide a background for subtheories from LIS and from Applied Ontology ."
Research questions	"As a result , we present some basic theory for IA in the form of a formal framework to represent corporations in which IA activities take place , acknowledging that our approach is de facto a subset of IA we call the enterprise information architecture ( EAI ) approach ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By doing this , we highlight the effects that documents cause within corporations in the scope of EIA ."
Research method	Many Twitter topics are annotated by hashtags .
Research questions	"In this article , we propose methods to predict the popularity of new hashtags on Twitter by formulating the problem as a classification task ."
Research method	"We use five standard classification models ( i. e. , Naive bayes , k-nearest neighbors , decision trees , support vector machines , and logistic regression ) for prediction ."
Research findings/conclusions	The main challenge is the identification of effective features for describing new hashtags .
Research method	We extract 7 content features from a hashtag string and the collection of tweets containing the hashtag and 11 contextual features from the social graph formed by users who have adopted the hashtag .
Research method	We conducted experiments on a Twitter data set consisting of 31 million tweets from 2 million Singapore-based users .
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that the standard classifiers using the extracted features significantly outperform the baseline methods that do not use these features .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the five classifiers , the logistic regression model performs the best in terms of the Micro-F1 measure ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also observe that contextual features are more effective than content features .
Research method	"First , global and overlay maps were developed for the 2 sets separately ."
Research method	"Using fuzzy-string matching and ISSN numbers , we were able to match 10,524 journal names between the 2 sets : 96.4 % of the 10,936 journals contained in JCR , or 51.2 % of the 20,554 journals covered by Scopus ."
Research method	Network analysis was pursued on the set of journals shared between the 2 databases and the 2 sets of unique journals .
Research findings/conclusions	"Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered in JCR than in Scopus , so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in Scopus ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree ( i.e. , numbers of citing journals ) or total citations is similar in both databases overall ( Spearman rank correlation > 0.97 ) , but some individual journals rank very differently ."
Research findings/conclusions	Journals that are unique to Scopus seem to be less importantthey are citing shared journals rather than being cited by thembut the humanities are covered better in Scopus than in JCR .
Research questions	"However , several institutional challenges inhibit the required implementation of innovative and information-centric tools to transform records management in response to the challenges of digitization and to capitalize on new opportunities in the digital economy ."
Research questions	"In this article , we make recommendations to overcome institutional and legislative barriers to transform records management in the public sector ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Among existing studies for document decomposition , some were limited by specific languages , according to topics or restricted to a document of two authors , and their accuracies have big room for improvement ."
Research questions	"In this paper , we consider the contextual correlation hidden among sentences and propose an algorithm for Sequential and Unsupervised Decomposition of a Multi-Author Document ( SUDMAD ) written in any language , disregarding topics , through the construction of a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) reflecting the authors ' writing styles ."
Research method	"To build and learn such a model , an unsupervised , statistical approach is first proposed to estimate the initial values of HMM parameters of a preliminary model , which does not require the availability of any information of author 's or document 's context other than how many authors contributed to writing the document ."
Research method	"To further boost the performance of this approach , a boosted HMM learning procedure is proposed next , where the initial classification results are used to create labeled training data to learn a more accurate HMM ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , the contextual relationship among sentences is further utilized to refine the classification results ."
Research method	Our proposed approach is empirically evaluated on three benchmark datasets that are widely used for authorship analysis of documents .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Comparisons with recent state-of-the-art approaches are also presented to demonstrate the significance of our new ideas and the superior performance of our approach .
Research method	"This study used a constructivist grounded theory approach to examine humanities scholars ' research practices , including their use of a wide range of resources and digital technologies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using in-depth study , several themes emerged from the research relating to the role of technology in shaping humanities scholars ' research practices ."
Research findings/conclusions	The themes include : ( a ) humanities scholars ' research approaches and technology tools ; ( b ) the humanities scholar as tool developer ; ( c ) the role of data preparation as a meta-level research practice ; ( d ) data visualization versus numeric outputs-one size does not fit all ; ( e ) the importance of flexibility and agency ; ( f ) technology tools in support of the researcher as writer ; and ( g ) working alone/working together-technology tools and collaborative practice .
Research questions	The heterogeneous nature of humanities scholars ' research practices are explored and the resulting implications for digital tool design .
Research findings/conclusions	Two new research practices-tool development and data preparation-are proposed .
Research questions	"The diverse digital technologies humanities scholars use support the traditional ways of working within their discipline , as well as creating potential for new scholarly practices ."
Research questions	"Given the exponential growth of new web applications and services , and the intense competition among them , attaining and retaining popularity are difficult ."
Research findings/conclusions	One possible approach to this problem is to enhance the competitiveness of a web presence by using appropriate web design mechanisms .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Research in this area has mainly focused on technological issues and usability studies .
Research questions	Few studies have paid attention to the socially constructed meaning ( cognition ) that is embedded in the context of media .
Research questions	"Drawing on the heuristic model from the social cognition perspective , the author posits that source credibility and content freshness are two important media-embedded heuristics potentially influential to the readership popularity of online interactive media sites ."
Research findings/conclusions	The content analysis results of 100 leading web-logs strongly supported this hypotheses .
Research findings/conclusions	Key quantitative Research findings/conclusions were also consistent with the qualitative evidence provided by 28 expert practitioners .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study expands our understanding of the related constructs from a social cognition perspective and calls for design attention to influential media-embedded traits when developing online interactive media and related websites .
Research findings/conclusions	Research shows that people conduct collaborative information searches while planning their travel activities online .
Research questions	"However , little is known in depth about tourists ' online collaborative search ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study examines tourists ' collaborative information search behavior in detail , including their search stages , online search strategies , and information flow breakdowns ."
Research method	"The data for analysis included pre- and postsearch questionnaires , web search and chat logs , and postsearch interviews ."
Research method	A model of tourist collaborative information retrieval was developed .
Research findings/conclusions	"The model identified collaborative planning , collaborative information searching , sharing of information , and collaborative decision making as four stages of tourists ' collaborative search ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that tourists collaborated by planning their search strategies , dividing search tasks into subtasks and allocating workload , using search queries and URL links recommended by teammates , and discussing search results together ."
Research findings/conclusions	Related personal knowledge and experiences appeared important in trip planning and collaborative information search .
Research findings/conclusions	"During the collaborative search , tourists also encountered various information flow breakdowns in different search stages ."
Research findings/conclusions	These were classified and their effects on collaborative information search were reported .
Research questions	Implications for system design in support of collaborative information retrieval in travel contexts are also discussed .
Research method	"Focusing on three main branches-diseases , drugs and chemicals , and techniques and equipment-we use base maps and overlay techniques to investigate the translations and interactions and thus to gain a bibliometric perspective on the dynamics of medical innovations ."
Research method	"To this end , we first analyze the MEDLINE database , the MeSH index tree , and the various options for a static mapping from different perspectives and at different levels of aggregation ."
Research method	"Following a specific innovation ( RNA interference ) over time , the notion of a trajectory which leaves a signature in the database is elaborated ."
Research method	Can the detailed index terms describing the dynamics of research be used to predict the diffusion dynamics of research results ?
Research method	"Possibilities are specified for further integration between the MEDLINE database on one hand , and the Science Citation Index and Scopus ( containing citation information ) on the other ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research investigated what happens if researchers de facto allow distractions to occur in a test situation .
Research questions	"It examined the type and magnitude of occurred distractions , the effects distractions have on completion scores , and whether different distractions affect different test activities differently ."
Research method	"In the research design , participants were randomly assigned to either a controlled environment or their natural environment ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that whereas participants in the natural environment needed more time to complete the post task questionnaire than their laboratory counterparts , they spent a similar amount of time on the tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants were capable of , and indeed willing to , limit the less-urgent distractions in the interests of getting the tasks done ."
Research findings/conclusions	"If they were interrupted by a human contact , however , the completion time for tasks increased significantly ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous studies showed that distractions change information behavior .
Research findings/conclusions	"Yet , the present results provide evidence that these changes do not always occur , and thus there needs to be a better demarcation of the limits within which distraction can be expected to change how people interact with information ."
Research method	"For this Research questions , from 6 selected subject fields ( condensed matter physics , inorganic and nuclear chemistry , electric and electronic engineering , biochemistry and molecular biology , physiology , and gastroenterology ) , original articles published in the same year were sampled ( n=230-240 for each field ) ."
Research method	"Then , the citation counts received by the articles in relatively long citation windows ( 6 and 11 years after publication ) were predicted by negative binomial multiple regression ( NBMR ) analysis for each field ."
Research method	"Various article features about author collaboration , cited references , visibility , authors ' achievements ( measured by past publications and citedness ) , and publishing journals were considered as the explanatory variables of NBMR ."
Research findings/conclusions	Some generality across the fields was found with regard to the selected predicting factors and the degree of significance of these predictors .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Price index was the strongest predictor of citations , and number of references was the next ."
Research findings/conclusions	The effects of number of authors and authors ' achievement measures were rather weak .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is shown that the corresponding function , h ( T ) , is concavely increasing ."
Research method	"Next , we construct an implicit relation between the h-index and the impact factor IF ( an average number of items per source ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The corresponding function h ( IF ) is increasing and we show that if the parameter C in the numerator of the shifted Lotka function is high , then the relation between the h-index and the impact factor is almost linear ."
Research questions	The tensions caused by this multiplicity of interests and singularity of output frame most collaborative research practice .
Research questions	The goal of present study is to identify areas of tension in such collaborative and heterogeneous efforts .
Research questions	"To this end , the present study investigates the coconstruction of archeological narrative at one of the largest multinational archeological campaigns in the world , the catalhoyuk project in Turkey ."
Research questions	This study conceptualizes archeological narratives as epistemic assemblages .
Research questions	"Following Actor Network theorists , the archeological process is conceptualized as a series of translation processes ( of heterogeneous engineering ) that inscribe the found material remains of archeological investigation into a narrative ."
Research findings/conclusions	This complex process takes place within a heterogeneous sociotechnical network .
Research method	This study decomposes this heterogeneous network to identify the areas of tension and struggle .
Research findings/conclusions	Two sources of such tensions are identified as fragmentation and fault lines .
Research questions	Overcoming fragmentation and fault lines is key for the success of heterogeneous scientific work and maintaining productive scientific collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of this study have applications beyond archeology and can inform the design of cyberin-frastructure for heterogeneous collaborations .
Research findings/conclusions	Current guidelines on publishing recommend making images accessible to all readers .
Research questions	"However , academic publishers do not always follow these guidelines and therefore fail to guarantee access by all readers to the visual content of academic articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	People with severe visual impairments can not access the visual content of images unless a text alternative describing the images is provided .
Research questions	"This study investigates the current use of texts commonly related to images in academic articles , such as captions and mentions , in order to assess their suitability as potential text alternatives to the images for readers who are blind or have severe low vision ."
Research method	"A sample of 30 academic articles in the fields of biomedicine , computer science , and mathematics was analyzed and quantitative and qualitative data were collected about images and their related texts ."
Research findings/conclusions	We suggest a practical and sustainable solution that can foster the adoption of good accessibility practices by authors and publishers and facilitate their inclusion in regular publishing workflows .
Research questions	Does topic modeling provide an alternative for co-word mapping in research practices using moderately sized document collections ?
Research method	We return to the word/document matrix using first a single text with a strong argument ( The Leiden Manifesto ) and then upscale to a sample of moderate size ( n = 5687 ) to study the pros and cons of the two approaches in terms of the resulting possibilities for making semantic maps that can serve an argument .
Research findings/conclusions	The results from co-wordmapping ( using two different routines ) versus topic modeling are significantly uncorrelated .
Research findings/conclusions	"Whereas components in the co-word maps can easily be designated , the topic models provide sets of words that are very differently organized ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In these samples , the topic models seem to reveal similarities other than semantic ones ( e.g. , linguistic ones ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In other words , topic modeling does not replace co-word mapping in small and medium-sized sets ; but the paper leaves open the possibility that topic modeling would work well for the semantic mapping of large sets ."
Research method	"In all , 15,000 random queries were formulated to GSC to obtain a list of 26,682 registered users ."
Research method	"From this list a network graph of 6,660 labels was built and classified according to the Scopus Subject Area classes ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results display a detailed label map of the most used ( > 15 times ) tags .
Research findings/conclusions	The structural analysis shows that the core of the network is occupied by computer sciencerelated disciplines that account for the most used and shared labels .
Research method	"This core is surrounded by clusters of disciplines related or close to computing such as Information Sciences , Mathematics , or Bioinformatics ."
Research findings/conclusions	Classical areas such as Chemistry and Physics are marginalized in the graph .
Research questions	It is suggested that GSC would in the future be an accurate source to map Science because it is based on the labels that scientists themselves use to describe their own research activity .
Research questions	"However , the popularity of Twitter has attracted not only legitimate users but also spammers who exploit social graphs , popular keywords , and hashtags for malicious Research questionss ."
Research method	"In this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the HSpam14 dataset , which contains 14 million tweets with spam and ham ( i.e. , nonspam ) labels , to understand spamming activities on Twitter ."
Research questions	"The primary focus of this paper is to analyze various aspects of spam on Twitter based on hashtags , tweet contents , and user profiles , which are useful for both tweet-level and user-level spam detection ."
Research method	"First , we compare the usage of hashtags in spam and ham tweets based on frequency , position , orthography , and co-occurrence ."
Research method	"Second , for content-based analysis , we analyze the variations in word usage , metadata , and near-duplicate tweets ."
Research method	"Third , for user-based analysis , we investigate user profile information ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In our study , we validate that spammers use popular hashtags to promote their tweets ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also observe differences in the usage of words in spam and ham tweets .
Research findings/conclusions	Spam tweets are more likely to be emphasized using exclamation points and capitalized words .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , we observe that spammers use multiple accounts to post near-duplicate tweets to promote their services and products ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Unlike spammers , legitimate users are likely to provide more information such as their locations and personal descriptions in their profiles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In summary , this study presents a comprehensive analysis of hashtags , tweet contents , and user profiles in Twitter spamming ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By specifying the functional role of a given piece of relevant information in the overall structure of a topic , the proposed typology provides a generic framework for integrating different pieces of clinical evidence and a multifaceted view of a clinical problem ."
Research questions	In medical problem solving structured knowledge plays a key role .
Research findings/conclusions	"The typology provides the conceptual basis for integrating and structuring knowledge ; it incorporates and goes beyond existing clinical schemes ( such as PICO and illness script ) and offers extra assistance for physicians as well as lay users ( such as patients and caregivers ) to manage the vast amount of diversified evidence , to maintain a structured view of the patient problem at hand , and ultimately to make well-grounded clinical choices ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Developed as a generic topical framework across topics and domains , the typology proved useful for clinical medicine once extended with domainspecific definitions and relationships ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article reports the Research findings/conclusions of using the adapted and extended typology in the analysis of 26 clinical questions and their evidence-based answers .
Research findings/conclusions	"The article concludes with potential applications of the typology to improve clinical information seeking , organizing , and processing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	It also introduces the degree of internationality of journals and references as new metrics for this Research questions .
Research method	"The journal impact factor ; the impact of references ; the internationality of authors , journals , and references ; and the number of authors , institutions , and references were all calculated for papers published in nanoscience and nanotechnology journals in the Web of Science from 2007 to 2009 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model on the data set , the impact factor of the publishing journal and the citation impact of the cited references were found to be the most effective determinants of citation counts in all four time periods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the entire 2007 to 2009 period , apart from journal internationality and author numbers and internationality , all other predictor variables had significant effects on citation counts ."
Research questions	"This article considers the connections between scientific and bibliographic classifications for music , taking general discourse about scientific classification and domain analysis as its starting point ."
Research method	"Three relationship characteristics are posited : similarity , causation , and time ."
Research method	"In discussions about similarity , accords and discords are analyzed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Further , the idea of a scale of accord is introduced , and issues with assuming a univocal scientific or bibliographic classification of music are discussed ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Causation and the idea of influence between scientific and bibliographic classifications for music are unpicked .
Research questions	"The connections between accordance and influence are explored , and the concept of differing Research questionss for different classification approaches is analyzed ."
Research method	"A temporal dimension is considered , and the dynamic nature of connections between music scientific and bibliographic classifications is established ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The idea of bifurcation is introduceda change of accordance over timewhich is prominent for musical instrument classification .
Research findings/conclusions	"The concluding model visualizes similarity , causation and temporal aspects as three dimensions , showing how scientific and bibliographic classifications for music are connected through a set of interconnected and complex relationships ."
Research questions	"In this article , we examine whether this diversification has also affected the handful of elite journals that are traditionally considered to be the best ."
Research method	We examine citation patterns during the past 40 years of seven long-standing traditionally elite journals and six journals that have been increasing in importance during the past 20 years .
Research findings/conclusions	"To be among the top 5 % or 1 % cited papers , papers now need about twice as many citations as they did 40 years ago ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Since the late 1980s and early 1990s , elite journals have been publishing a decreasing proportion of these top-cited papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	This also applies to the two journals that are typically considered as the top venues and often used as bibliometric indicators of excellence : Science and Nature .
Research findings/conclusions	"On the other hand , several new and established journals are publishing an increasing proportion of the most-cited papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	These changes bring new challenges and opportunities for all parties .
Research findings/conclusions	Journals can enact policies to increase or maintain their relative position in the journal hierarchy .
Research findings/conclusions	Researchers now have the option to publish in more diverse venues knowing that their work can still reach the same audiences .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , evaluators and administrators need to know that although there will always be a certain prestige associated with publishing in elite journals , journal hierarchies are in constant flux ."
Research method	A set of 862 academic documents relating to social tagging and published from 2005 to 2011 was thus examined using bibliometric analysis as well as the social network analysis technique .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that social tagging , as a research area , develops rapidly and attracts an increasing number of new entrants ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are no key authors , publication sources , or research groups that dominate the research domain of social tagging ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research on social tagging appears to focus mainly on the following three aspects : ( a ) components and functions of social tagging ( e.g. , tags , tagging objects , and tagging network ) , ( b ) taggers ' behaviors and interface design , and ( c ) tags ' organization and usage in social tagging ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The trend suggest that more researchers turn to the latter two integrated with human computer interface and information retrieval , although the first aspect is the fundamental one in social tagging ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , more studies relating to social tagging pay attention to multimedia tagging objects and not only text tagging ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Previous research on social tagging was limited to a few subject domains such as information science and computer science .
Research questions	"As an interdisciplinary research area , social tagging is anticipated to attract more researchers from different disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	"More practical applications , especially in high-tech companies , is an encouraging research trend in social tagging ."
Research method	"This study explored whether a search interface based on the Bing API and enabled by Scatter/Gather , a well-known document-clustering technique , can improve health information searches ."
Research method	Forty participants without medical backgrounds were randomly assigned to two interfaces : a baseline interface that resembles typical web search engines and a Scatter/Gather interface .
Research method	Both groups performed two lookup and two exploratory health-related tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	It was found that the baseline group was more likely to rephrase queries and less likely to access general-Research questions sites than the Scatter/Gather group when completing exploratory tasks .
Research findings/conclusions	"Otherwise , the two groups did not differ in behavior and task performance , with participants in the Scatter/Gather group largely overlooking the features ( key words , clusters , and the recluster function ) designed to facilitate the exploration of semantic relationships between information objects , a potentially useful means for users in the rather unfamiliar domain of health ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results suggest a strong effect of users ' mental models of search on their use of search interfaces and a high cognitive cost associated with using the Scatter/Gather features .
Research findings/conclusions	It follows that novel features of a search interface should not only be compatible with users ' mental models but also provide sufficient affordance to inform users of how they can be used .
Research findings/conclusions	"Compared with the interface , tasks showed more significant impacts on search behavior ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In future studies , more effort should be devoted to identify salient features of health-related information needs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This paper explores the actual privacy practices of popular disaster apps , highlighting location information flows ."
Research method	"Our empirical study compares content analysis of privacy policies and government agency policies , structured by the contextual integrity framework , with static and dynamic app analysis documenting the personal data sent by 15 apps ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We identify substantive gaps between regulation and guidance , privacy policies , and information flows , resulting from ambiguities and exploitation of exemptions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results also indicate gaps between governance and practice , including the following : ( a ) Many apps ignore self-defined policies ; ( b ) while some policies state they might access location data under certain conditions , those conditions are not met as 12 apps included in our study capture location immediately upon initial launch under default settings ; and ( c ) not all third-party data recipients are identified in policy , including instances that violate expectations of trusted third parties ."
Research questions	"We focus on some topics of particular interest to the information science community : data infrastructures for scholarly communication and research , the politicization of data curation and visualization for public-facing dashboards , and human subjects research and policies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude with some areas of opportunity and need , including broader and richer data curation education in the information schools , the establishment of better data management policy implementations by research funders , the award of formal academic credit for data curation activities and data sharing , and engagement in cooperative action around data ethics and security ."
Research questions	One approach to extracting biomedical knowledge involves using citation relations to discover entity relations .
Research method	"The assumption is that citation relations between any two articles connect knowledge entities across the articles , enabling the detection of implicit relationships among biomedical entities ."
Research questions	The goal of this article is to examine the characteristics of biomedical entities connected via intermediate entities using citation relations aided by text mining .
Research method	"Based on the importance of symptoms as biomedical entities , we created triples connected via citation relations to identify drug-disease pairs with shared symptoms as intermediate entities ."
Research method	Drug-disease interactions built via citation relations were compared with co-occurrence-based interactions .
Research method	Several types of analyses were adopted to examine the properties of the extracted entity pairs by comparing them with drug-disease interaction databases .
Research questions	We attempted to identify the characteristics of drug-disease pairs through citation relations in association with biomedical entities .
Research findings/conclusions	The results showed that the citation relation-based approach resulted in diverse types of biomedical entities and preserved topical consistency .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , drug-disease pairs identified only via citation relations are interesting for clinical trials when they are examined using BITOLA ."
Research questions	"However , current studies have overly focused on source attributes as indicators for 2 criteria , source quality and accessibility , and overlooked the role of other factors and criteria that help determine source selection ."
Research method	"To fill this gap , guided by decision-making theories and the cognitive perspective to information search , we interviewed 30 participants about their reasons for using a wide range of sources for health information ."
Research method	"Additionally , we asked each of them to report a critical incident in which sources were selected to fulfill a specific information need ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the analysis of the transcripts , 5 categories of factors were identified as influential to source selection : source-related factors , user-related factors , user-source relationships , characteristics of the problematic situation , and social influences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , about a dozen criteria that mediate the influence of the factors on source-selection decisions were identified , including accessibility , quality , usability , interactivity , relevance , usefulness , familiarity , affection , anonymity , and appropriateness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These results significantly expanded the current understanding of the nature of costs and benefits involved in source-selection decisions , and strongly indicated that a personalized approach is needed for information services and information systems to provide effective access to health information sources for consumers ."
Research questions	"Because nonprofit organizations differ from commercial , educational , or governmental sectors , it is important to understand the ways they utilize the web ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"To the best of our knowledge , the linking structure of nonprofit organizations has not been previously studied ."
Research method	We surveyed websites of 54 nonprofit organizations in Israel ; most of these sites have at least 100 volunteers .
Research method	We compared their orientation and contents and we built their linking map .
Research method	"We divided the organizations into four main groups : economic aid and citizen rights organizations , health aid organizations , organizations supporting families and individuals with special needs , and organizations for women and children ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that the number of links inside the special needs group is much higher than in the other groups .
Research findings/conclusions	We tried to explain this behavior by considering the data obtained from the site-linking graph .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The value of our results is in defining and testing a method to investigate a group of nonprofit organizations , using a case study of Israeli organizations ."
Research method	"The basis for the analysis is the Flemish Academic Bibliographic Database for the Social Sciences and Humanities ( VABB-SHW ) , a comprehensive bibliographic database of peer-reviewed publications in the SSH by researchers affiliated with Flemish universities ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Combining data on journal articles and book chapters , our Research findings/conclusions indicate that collaborative publishing in the SSH is increasing , though considerable differences between disciplines remain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Conversely , we did observe a sharp decline in single-author publishing ."
Research findings/conclusions	We further demonstrate that coauthored SSH articles in journals indexed in the Web of Science ( WoS ) generally have a higher ( and growing ) number of coauthors than do either those in non-WoS journals or book chapters .
Research findings/conclusions	This illustrates the need to include non-WoS data and book chapters when studying coauthorship in the SSH .
Research questions	"Nevertheless , despite some research into specific images , such as selfies , and a few news stories about specific tweeted photographs , little is known about the types of images that are routinely shared ."
Research method	"In response , this article reports a content analysis of random samples of 800 images tweeted from the UK or USA during a week at the end of 2014 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Although most images were photographs , a substantial minority were hybrid or layered image forms : phone screenshots , collages , captioned pictures , and pictures of text messages ."
Research findings/conclusions	"About half were primarily of one or more people , including 10 % that were selfies , but a wide variety of other things were also pictured ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Some of the images were for advertising or to share a joke but in most cases the Research questions of the tweet seemed to be to share the minutiae of daily lives , performing the function of chat or gossip , sometimes in innovative ways ."
Research method	We conducted a systematic literature review to lay the groundwork for understanding the relationship between SNS use and users ' psychological well-being and for devising strategies for taking advantage of this relationship .
Research method	"The review included articles published between 2003 and 2016 , extracted from major academic databases ."
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions revealed that the use of SNSs is both positively and negatively related to users ' psychological well-being .
Research questions	We discuss the factors that moderate this relationship and their implications on users ' psychological well-being .
Research findings/conclusions	"Many of the studies we reviewed lacked a sound theoretical justification for their Research findings/conclusions and most involved young and healthy students , leaving other cohorts of SNS users neglected ."
Research findings/conclusions	The paper concludes with the presentation of a platform for future investigation .
Research method	"To determine the most important words of a given text , the term frequencies ( tf ) or the tfidf weighting scheme can be applied ."
Research questions	"Recently , latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) has been proposed to define the topics included in a corpus ."
Research questions	"As another strategy , this study proposes to apply a vocabulary specificity measure ( Zscore ) to determine the most significantly overused word-types or short sequences of them ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our experiments show that the simple term frequency measure is not able to discriminate between specific terms associated with a document or a set of texts .
Research method	"Using the tf idf or LDA approach , the selection requires some arbitrary decisions ."
Research method	"Based on the term-specific measure ( Zscore ) , the term selection has a clear theoretical basis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the most significant sentences for each presidency can be determined ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"As another facet , we can visualize the dynamic evolution of usage of some terms associated with their specificity measures ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , this technique can be employed to define the most important lexical leaders introducing terms overused by the k following presidencies ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By using the Arpanet Host-Host Protocol and its sockets as an entry point for studying the generation of metadata , we show that the development and function of key Arpanet infrastructure can be studied by examining the creation and stabilization of metadata ."
Research questions	"More specifically , we use the Host-Host Protocol 's sockets as an example of something that , at the level of the network , functions as both network infrastructure and metadata simultaneously ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By presenting the function of sockets in tandem with an overview of the Host-Host Protocol , we argue for the further integrated study of infrastructure and metadata ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Finally , we reintroduce the concept of infradata to refer specifically to data that locate data throughout an infrastructure and are required by the infrastructure to function , separating them from established and stabilized standards ."
Research questions	"We argue for the future application of infradata as a concept for the study of histories and political economies of networks , bridging the largely library and information science ( LIS ) study of metadata with the largely science and technology studies ( STS ) domain of infrastructure ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article reports the Research findings/conclusions of a case study that investigated the use of image and multimedia resources in an undergraduate classroom .
Research method	The study assumed a contextual approach and focused on different class contexts and students ' literacy practices .
Research findings/conclusions	"The class , which took place in a resource-rich , multimodal environment , was perceived by students as a positive learning experience ."
Research findings/conclusions	The distribution of resources and their role in teaching and learning varied and depended on the context of use .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions indicate that images fulfilled important descriptive and mnemonic functions when students were introduced to new concepts , but their role was limited in practices that required students to analyze and synthesize knowledge ."
Research method	Searches using each term are conducted in JSTOR and in selected additional full-text journal sources from over the years 1987-2011 .
Research method	"Two measures of OBI are used , one simply tallying the presence or absence of references to Simon 's oeuvre ( strict OBI ) linked to the catch phrase and one counting only papers lacking any embedded reference as evidence of obliteration ( lenient OBI ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By either measure , OBI existed but varied across subject area , time period , and catch phrase ."
Research findings/conclusions	Economics had the highest strict OBI ( 82 % ) and lenient OBI ( 43 % ) for bounded rationality and the highest strict OBI ( 64 % ) for satisficing ; all 3 subject areas were essentially tied for lenient OBI at about 30 % .
Research findings/conclusions	Sixty-two percent of the articles for bounded rationalitypsychology were retrieved only because the catch phrase occurred in a title in the article bibliography .
Research findings/conclusions	OBI research can benefit from full-text searching ; the main tradeoff is more detailed and nuanced evidence concerning OBI existence and trends versus increased noise in the retrieval .
Research questions	State-of-the-art approaches view it as an expert search or resource selection problem .
Research questions	We investigate the effect of content-based similarity between posts on the performance of the retrieval system .
Research method	We test two different approaches for smoothing ( regularizing ) relevance scores of posts based on their dependencies .
Research method	"In the first approach , we smooth term distributions describing posts by performing a random walk over a document-term graph in which similar posts are highly connected ."
Research method	"In the second , we directly smooth scores for posts using a regularization framework that aims to minimize the discrepancy between scores for similar documents ."
Research method	We then extend these approaches to consider the time interval between the posts in smoothing the scores .
Research questions	"The idea is that if two posts are temporally close , then they are good sources for smoothing each other 's relevance scores ."
Research method	We compare these methods with the state-of-the-art approaches in blog search that employ Language Modeling-based resource selection algorithms and fusion-based methods for aggregating post relevance scores .
Research findings/conclusions	We show performance gains over the baseline techniques which do not take advantage of the relation between posts for smoothing relevance estimates .
Research method	"Based on an extensive interdisciplinary review , I provide a novel framework that presents resonance as a spectrum of experience with a multitude of outcomes ranging from a sense of harmony and coherence to life transformation ."
Research questions	I argue that resonance has different properties to the more traditional interpretation of relevance and provides a better system of explanation of what it means to experience relevance .
Research value/outlook/limitations	I show how traditional approaches to relevance and resonance work in a complementary fashion and outline how resonance may present distinct new lines of research into relevance theory .
Research method	"As part of this project , the authors explored informal learning methods that the groups could benefit from and practiced them with the community representatives who played key roles in the daily life of the organizations ."
Research method	"In the present article , the authors reflect on the developmental trajectories observed for two individuals , each from a different nonprofit organization , with respect to information technology efficacy and ability ."
Research method	"The authors analyze these trajectories as a sequence of the following four technology-related roles-technology consumers , technology planners , technology doers , and technology sustainers ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The authors describe these roles , the methods used to promote informal learning , and implications for other researchers studying informal learning in communities ."
Research questions	Such knowledge provides a basis for designing systems for providing complementary health information .
Research questions	"This article discusses how patients ' conceptualizations of their health-information-related preferences , motivations , and needs are linked to the perceived role of medical records as an informational artifact ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We identified seven subject positions : ( P1 ) Hypothetically positive to e-health services generally , ( P2 ) Positive to reading medical records due to implications , ( P3 ) Positive to all Internet use including medical records online , ( P4 ) Distrustful and wants to be in control of health treatment , ( P5 ) Worried about health , ( P6 ) Wants communication with health care professionals , and ( P7 ) Do not understand their medical record ."
Research findings/conclusions	These subject positions can explain the worry and enthusiasm documented in earlier literature .
Research findings/conclusions	The diversity of subject positions implies that health care information services should be planned with different subject positions in mind rather than a simple demographic group .
Research findings/conclusions	Special attention needs to be given to finding flexible solutions that address the opportunities and worries of the identified subject positions .
Research questions	Institutions that are spread across multiple geographic locations face additional challenges .
Research method	"To better understand the nature of cross-campus collaboration within a single institution and the effects of institutional efforts to spark collaboration , we conducted a case study of collaboration at Cornell University using scientometric and network analyses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results suggest that crosscampus collaboration is increasingly common , but is accounted for primarily by a relatively small number of departments and individual researchers ."
Research method	"Specific researchers involved in many collaborative projects are identified , and their unique characteristics are described ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Institutional efforts , such as seed grants and topical retreats , have some effect for researchers who are central in the collaboration network , but were less clearly effective for others ."
Research findings/conclusions	This article shows that one way to do this is through the concept of understanding .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Visual art is identified as an illuminating domain for an initial foray into such research .
Research method	This article presents Research findings/conclusions from a phenomenology-of-practice study of the information behavior of visual artists .
Research method	"Seven local artists documented their experiences creating self-portraits , and semistructured follow-up interviews were conducted ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions show how these participants built understanding with information in their work of creating individual self-portraits .
Research findings/conclusions	These understandings fall into two categories : of the self and of the artistic process .
Research findings/conclusions	"Many forms of information , traditional and novel , contribute to these understandings ; examples of the latter include memories , the lived environment , profound experiences , and online browsing ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These Research findings/conclusions extend the literature on artists ' information behavior , connect everyday information behavior to information experience , and illustrate a method for studying understanding empirically in information science ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The article closes by discussing the meaning of these Research findings/conclusions for the future of information science , suggesting that the kinds of information employed by artists might be recognized and appreciated more widely throughout society ."
Research method	A seed set of 901 articles published between 1973 and 2015 was evaluated and in total 65 studies were considered for further analyses .
Research method	Data extraction and synthesis was performed through content analysis using the PRISMA method .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three thematic categories were identified in regard to music information needs : ( a ) those related to scholarly activities , ( b ) musically motivated , as well as ( c ) those which are related to socializing and communication ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , 3 categories of music information sources were connected to musical creativity : ( i ) those that are related to Internet and media technologies , ( ii ) those that are related to music libraries , organizations , and music stores , and ( iii ) those that are related to the subjects ' social settings ."
Research questions	"The paper provides a systematic review , with the aim of showcasing the effect of modern information retrieval techniques in a creative and intensive area of information-dependent activity such as music making and consumption ."
Research questions	"However , most current methods focus on increasing the performance , leaving the semantic gap problem , which refers to the learned ranking models are hard to be understood , remaining intact ."
Research questions	"Therefore , in this article , we aim at learning an interpretable ranking model to tackle the semantic gap in fine-grained image ranking ."
Research questions	We propose to combine attribute-based representation and online passive-aggressive ( PA ) learning based ranking models to achieve this goal .
Research method	"Besides , considering the highly localized instances in fine-grained image ranking , we introduce a supervised constrained clustering method to gather class-balanced training instances for local PA-based models , and incorporate the learned local models into a unified probabilistic framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed .
Research method	"It presents the results of a survey covering higher education libraries in Australia , Canada , Germany , Ireland , the Netherlands , New Zealand , and the UK ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that libraries have provided leadership in RDM , particularly in advocacy and policy development ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Service development is still limited , focused especially on advisory and consultancy services ( such as data management planning support and data-related training ) , rather than technical services ( such as provision of a data catalog , and curation of active data ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Data curation skills development is underway in libraries , but skills and capabilities are not consistently in place and remain a concern ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Other major challenges include resourcing , working with other support services , and achieving buy in from researchers and senior managers ."
Research method	Results are compared with previous studies in order to assess trends and relative maturity levels .
Research findings/conclusions	"The range of RDM activities explored in this study are positioned on a landscape maturity model , which reflects current and planned research data services and practice in academic libraries , representing a snapshot of current developments and a baseline for future research ."
Research questions	This is a problem because the discourse of the weak discipline creates conceptual confusion in relation to interdisciplinarity .
Research questions	"Considering the growth of the iSchools and what is assumed to be a major institutional redrawing of boundaries , there is a pressing need to conceptualize interdisciplinary practices and boundary work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper explores the weak discipline through a discourse analytical lens and identifies a myth .
Research findings/conclusions	"Perceiving the discipline as weak is part of a myth , fueled by the ideal of a unitary discipline ; the ideal discipline has strong boundaries , and as long as the discourse continues to focus on a need for boundaries , the only available discourse is one that articulates the discipline as weak ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , the myth is a vicious circle that can be broken if weakness is no longer ascribed to the discipline by tradition ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The paper offers an explanation of the workings of the myth so that its particular way of interpreting the world does not mislead us when theorizing interdisciplinarity .
Research method	"This is a conceptual paper , and the examples serve as an empirical backdrop to the conceptual argument ."
Research questions	"A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence ( CI ) , which is a shared intelligence among all participants ."
Research questions	This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources .
Research method	"This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values , number of participants , and top frequency ranking window ."
Research method	"Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists : overlapList , overlapRank , Footrule , Fagin 's measure , and the Inverse Rank measure ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging , and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI ; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources .
Research findings/conclusions	We present the search trends adolescents display and develop a framework of search roles that these trends help define .
Research method	"We compare these trends and roles to similar trends and roles found in prior work with children ages 7 , 9 , and 11 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We use these comparisons to make recommendations to adult stakeholders such as researchers , designers , and information literacy educators about the best ways to design search tools for children and adolescents , as well as how to use the framework of searching roles to find better methods of educating youth searchers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Major Research findings/conclusions include the seven roles of adolescent searchers , and evidence that adolescents are social in their computer use , have a greater knowledge of sources than younger children , and that adolescents are less frustrated by searching tasks than younger children ."
Research method	"Drawing on the extant literature on innovation adoption and opinion leadership , we propose two dimensions of crowdfunders that capture the heterogeneity in crowdfunders & apos ; behavior : opinion leadership and interest specialization of crowdfunders ."
Research method	"Using a set of variables representing these two dimensions , our analysis revealed five distinct archetypes of crowdfunders : the Vocal Actives , the Silent Actives , the Focused Enthusiasts , the Trend Followers , and the Star Seekers , who each adopted distinct crowdfunding strategies ."
Research findings/conclusions	We established external and criterion-related validity of the cluster solutions in multiple ways .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results suggest that the composition of crowdfunders is complex , even within a single platform ."
Research method	"Keywords Plus and Author Keywords are commonly selected as units of analysis , despite the limited research evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of Keywords Plus ."
Research questions	This study was conceived to evaluate the efficacy of Keywords Plus as a parameter for capturing the content and scientific concepts presented in articles .
Research method	"Using scientific papers about patient adherence that were retrieved from WOS , a comparative assessment of Keywords Plus and Author Keywords was performed at the scientific field level and the document level , respectively ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our search yielded more Keywords Plus terms than Author Keywords , and the Keywords Plus terms were more broadly descriptive ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Keywords Plus is as effective as Author Keywords in terms of bibliometric analysis investigating the knowledge structure of scientific fields , but it is less comprehensive in representing an article 's content ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"While previous research has analyzed trending topics over the long term , we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend , with the aim of categorizing trends early on ."
Research findings/conclusions	This allows us to provide a filtered subset of trends to end users .
Research method	We experiment with a set of straightforward language-independent features based on the social spread of trends and categorize them using the typology .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our method provides an efficient way to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data , enabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time , or to quickly identify viral memes that might inform marketing decisions , among others ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with each type of trend , such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many were likely sent from mobile devices , or memes having more retweets originating from a few trend-setters ."
Research method	"This study investigates the impact of TED Talks videos on YouKu , a Chinese video portal , and YouTube using 6 measures of impact : number of views ; likes ; dislikes ; comments ; bookmarks ; and shares ."
Research questions	"In particular , we study the relationship between the topicality and impact of these videos ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions demonstrate that topics vary greatly in terms of their impact : Topics on entertainment and psychology/philosophy receive more views and likes , whereas design/art and astronomy/biology/oceanography attract fewer comments and bookmarks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , we identify several topical differences between YouKu and YouTube users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Topics on global issues and technology are more popular on YouKu , whereas topics on entertainment and psychology/philosophy are more popular on YouTube ."
Research findings/conclusions	"By analyzing the popularity distribution of videos and the audience characteristics of YouKu , we find that women are more interested in topics on education and psychology/philosophy , whereas men favor topics on technology and astronomy/biology/oceanography ."
Research findings/conclusions	"A central idea is to gradually increase the user 's knowledge about the contents , structures , and semantics of the data sources in the dataspace ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Without this knowledge , the user is not able to make sophisticated queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	The dataspace systems proposed so far are usually application specific .
Research questions	"In contrast , our idea in this paper is to develop an application-independent extensible markup language ( XML ) dataspace system with versatile facilities ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike the other proposed dataspace systems , we show that it is possible to build an interface based on conventional visual tools in terms of which the user can satisfy his or her sophisticated information needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In our system , the user does not need to master programming techniques nor the XML syntax , which provides a good starting point for its declarative use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the selection of results by users can be interpreted as a confirmation of the relevance of those results , and used to reorder or prioritize subsequent search results ."
Research questions	"This collection of search/result pairings is called clickthrough data , and many uses for it have been proposed ."
Research questions	"However , the reliability of clickthrough data has been challenged and it has been suggested that clickthrough data are not a completely accurate measure of relevance between search term and results ."
Research method	This paper reports on an experiment evaluating the reliability of clickthrough data as a measure of the mutual relevance of search term and result .
Research method	"The experiment comprised a user study involving over 67 participants and determines the reliability of image search clickthrough data , using factors identified in previous similar studies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"A major difference in this work to previous work is that the source of clickthrough data comes from image searches , rather than the traditional text page searches ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Image search clickthrough data were rarely examined in prior works but has differences that impact the accuracy of clickthrough data .
Research findings/conclusions	"These differences include a more complete representation of the results in image search , allowing users to scrutinize the results more closely before selecting them , as well as presenting the results in a less obviously ordered way ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The experiment reported here demonstrates that image clickthrough data can be more reliable as a relevance feedback measure than has been the case with traditional text-based search .
Research findings/conclusions	There is also evidence that the precision of the search system influences the accuracy of click data when users make searches in an information-seeking capacity .
Research questions	"In this study , we reexamine the question of the growth of science ."
Research method	To do this we ( a ) use current data up to publication year 2012 and ( b ) analyze the data across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences .
Research method	"Furthermore , the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical techniquesegmented regression analysiswhich can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science ."
Research method	"The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data : ( a ) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science ( WoS , Thomson Reuters ) per publication year and ( b ) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year ."
Research method	We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s .
Research findings/conclusions	"In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science , which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase : from less than 1 % up to the middle of the 18th century , to 2 to 3 % up to the period between the two world wars , and 8 to 9 % to 2010 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show the existence of a problem that advanced statistical methods are provably incapable of solving due to the presence of initial and inevitable model uncertainties arising from a qualitative set of base quantities and the number of variables which are considered , even before verifying the different sources of the uncertainties and executing any experimental measurements or computer calculations ."
Research findings/conclusions	The information contained in the model can be used theoretically and practically to test the solutions to a wide range of problems .
Research findings/conclusions	"Revealing the measurement accuracy limit ( in addition to the Heisenberg inequality ) with the help of the information transmitted from the studied phenomenon to the observer , which is then stored in the model , helps to perform two additional tasks : choosing the preferred method for measuring a particular physical constant , in physics ; and calculating the exact value of the threshold discrepancy between the model and the measured object , in measurement theory ."
Research findings/conclusions	Further research indicates the possibility of allying these methods in biological and medical sciences .
Research method	"The readersourcing.org system is then presented as an independent , third-party , nonprofit , and academic/scientific endeavor aimed at quality rating of scholarly literature and scholars , and some possible criticisms are discussed ."
Research questions	Such image retrieval is complicated by the fact that figures in the scientific literature often combine multiple individual subfigures ( panels ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Multipanel figures are in fact the predominant pattern in certain types of scientific publications .
Research questions	The goal of this work is to automatically segment multipanel figuresa necessary step for automatic semantic indexing and in the development of image retrieval systems targeting the scientific literature .
Research method	We have developed a method that uses the image content as well as the associated figure caption to : ( 1 ) automatically detect panel boundaries ; ( 2 ) detect panel labels in the images and convert them to text ; and ( 3 ) detect the labels and textual descriptions of each panel within the captions .
Research method	Our approach combines the output of image-content and text-based processing steps to split the multipanel figures into individual subfigures and assign to each subfigure its corresponding section of the caption .
Research findings/conclusions	The developed system achieved precision of 81 % and recall of 73 % on the task of automatic segmentation of multipanel figures .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Attention is paid to the grounds by which the participants bolster the informational support .
Research method	The Research findings/conclusions draw on the analysis of 200 threads of a Finnish online discussion group and a Yahoo !
Research method	Answers Q & A ( question and answer ) forum .
Research findings/conclusions	"Three main types of informational support were identified : providing factual information , providing advice , and providing personal opinion ."
Research findings/conclusions	The grounds used in the answers varied across the types of informational support .
Research findings/conclusions	"While providing factual information , the most popular ground was description of the attributes of an entity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the context of providing advice , reference to external sources of information was employed most frequently ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , although providing personal opinions , the participants most often bolstered their views by articulating positive or negative evaluations of an entity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , regarding the grounds , there were more similarities than differences between the discussion group and the Q & A site ."
Research method	This study focused on describing how U.S. teens from a highly technological suburban high school select ICT 's for personal communication Research questionss .
Research method	Two research questions guided the study : ( a ) What factors influence high school seniors selection of online social networks and other ICT 's for everyday communication ?
Research questions	( b ) How can social network theory ( SNT ) help to explain how teens select online social networks and other ICT 's for everyday communication Research questionss ?
Research method	"Using focus groups , a purposive sample of 45 teens were asked to discuss ( a ) their preferred methods for communicating with friends and family and why , ( b ) the reasons why they chose to engage ( or not to engage ) in online social networking , ( c ) how they selected ICT 's for social networking and other communication Research questionss , and ( d ) how they decided whom to accept as online friends ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions indicated that many factors influenced participants ICT selection practices including six major categories of selection factors : relationship factors , information/communication factors , social factors , systems factors , self-protection factors , and recipient factors ."
Research findings/conclusions	SNT was also helpful in explaining how friendship was a major determining factor in their communication media and platform choices .
Research value/outlook/limitations	These models have been previously empirically tested assuming a mathematical model and predetermining the models ' parameter values at some fixed constant .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"The present study , from a statistical modeling viewpoint , investigates alternative distributions commonly used for this type of point data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study shows that the typical assumptions for the parameters of the h-index mathematical models in such representations are not always realistic , with more suitable specifications being favorable ."
Research findings/conclusions	Prediction of the h-index is also demonstrated .
Research questions	"A major hurdle for current state-of-the-art automatic methods for sentiment analysis is the fact that human communication often involves the use of sarcasm or irony , where the author means the opposite of what she/he says ."
Research findings/conclusions	Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite .
Research questions	Lack of naturally occurring utterances labeled for sarcasm is one of the key problems for the development of machine-learning methods for sarcasm detection .
Research method	We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author .
Research method	We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm .
Research questions	We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine-learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine-learning techniques and human judges on this task .
Research findings/conclusions	This approach bears the risk of incorrectly merging or splitting author identities .
Research method	The use of initial-based disambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not affect research Research findings/conclusions too much .
Research method	"This paper tests that assumption by analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields-biology , computer science , nanoscience , neuroscience , and physics-and an interdisciplinary journal , PNAS ."
Research method	Name instances in data sets of this study were disambiguated based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions .
Research method	We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of three types of initial-based disambiguation .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of coauthorship networks : It deflates the number of unique authors , number of components , average shortest paths , clustering coefficient , and assortativity , while it inflates average productivity , density , average coauthor number per author , and largest component size ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , on average , more than half of top 10 productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	Asian names were found to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based disambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials .
Research method	"This study describes and examines a set of tags using quantitative and qualitative methods and assesses relationships among categories of image tags , tag assignment order , and users ' perceptions of usefulness of index terms and user-contributed tags ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study found that tags provide much descriptive information about an image but that users also value and trust controlled vocabulary terms .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study found no correlation between tag length and assignment order , and tag length and its perceived usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions of this study can contribute to the design of controlled vocabularies , indexing processes , and retrieval systems for images ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , the Research findings/conclusions of the study can advance the understanding of image tagging practices , tag facet/category distributions , relative usefulness and importance of these categories to the user , and potential mechanisms for identifying useful terms ."
Research questions	"This study aims to examine the information journey experienced by marketing professionals , including task-driven information seeking , information judgments , information use , and information sharing , from a more contextualized and holistic viewpoint ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The information journey presents a more comprehensive picture of user-information interaction than is usually offered in the literature .
Research method	"Using a diary method and post-diary in-depth interviews , data consisting of 1,198 diary entries relating to 101 real work tasks were collected over a period of 5 work days ."
Research method	The data were used to ascertain characteristics of the stages of marketing professionals ' information journeys as well as the relationships between them .
Research findings/conclusions	"Five stages of the information journey , including determining the need for work task-generated information , seeking such information , judging and evaluating the information found , making sense of and using the obtained information , and sharing the obtained or assembled information , were identified ."
Research findings/conclusions	The information journey also encompassed types of gaps and gap-bridge techniques that occurred during information seeking and use .
Research method	"Based on the empirical Research findings/conclusions , an information journey model was developed ."
Research questions	The implications for information systems design solutions that enable different stages of the information journey to be linked together are also discussed .
Research method	This paper presents a machine-learning approach to automatically detect this kind of information in the review domain .
Research method	"The resulting system works in two steps : in the first pass , negation/speculation cues are identified , and in the second phase the full scope of these cues is determined ."
Research method	"The system is trained and evaluated on the Simon Fraser University Review corpus , which is extensively used in opinion mining ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show how the proposed method outstrips the baseline by as much as roughly 20 % in the negation cue detection and around 13 % in the scope recognition , both in terms of F-1 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In speculation , the performance obtained in the cue prediction phase is close to that obtained by a human rater carrying out the same task ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In the scope detection , the results are also promising and represent a substantial improvement on the baseline ( up by roughly 10 % ) ."
Research method	A detailed error analysis is also provided .
Research findings/conclusions	The extrinsic evaluation shows that the correct identification of cues and scopes is vital for the task of sentiment analysis .
Research questions	"In particular , to answer geographic and temporal user queries , the IR task becomes a nonstraightforward process where the available geographic and temporal information is often unstructured ."
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a geotemporal search approach that consists of modeling and exploiting geographic and temporal query context evidence that refers to implicit multivarying geographic and temporal intents behind the query ."
Research method	Modeling geographic and temporal query contexts is based on extracting and ranking geographic and temporal keywords found in pseudo-relevant feedback ( PRF ) documents for a given query .
Research method	Our geotemporal search approach is based on exploiting the geographic and temporal query contexts separately into a probabilistic ranking model and jointly into a proximity ranking model .
Research method	"Our hypothesis is based on the concept that geographic and temporal expressions tend to co-occur within the document where the closer they are in the document , the more relevant the document is ."
Research method	"Finally , geographic , temporal , and proximity scores are combined according to a linear combination formula ."
Research findings/conclusions	An extensive experimental evaluation conducted on a portion of the New York Times news collection and the TREC 2004 robust retrieval track collection shows that our geotemporal approach outperforms significantly a well-known baseline search and the best known geotemporal search approaches in the domain .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , an in-depth analysis shows a positive correlation between the geographic and temporal query sensitivity and the retrieval performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , we find that geotemporal distance has a positive impact on retrieval performance generally ."
Research questions	"Among these applications , the task of identifying the word sense based on Wikipedia is a crucial component because the output of this component is often used in subsequent tasks ."
Research questions	"In this article , we present a two-stage framework ( called TSDW ) for word sense disambiguation using knowledge latent in Wikipedia ."
Research method	"The disambiguation of a given phrase is applied through a two-stage disambiguation process : ( a ) The first-stage disambiguation explores the contextual semantic information , where the noisy information is pruned for better effectiveness and efficiency ; and ( b ) the second-stage disambiguation explores the disambiguated phrases of high confidence from the first stage to achieve better redisambiguation decisions for the phrases that are difficult to disambiguate in the first stage ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , existing studies have addressed the disambiguation problem for English text only ."
Research questions	"Considering the popular usage of Wikipedia in different languages , we study the performance of TSDW and the existing state-of-the-art approaches over both English and Traditional Chinese articles ."
Research findings/conclusions	The experimental results show that TSDW generalizes well to different semantic relatedness measures and text in different languages .
Research findings/conclusions	"More important , TSDW significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with both better effectiveness and efficiency ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Behavioral research describes 3 conflict types : task-related , affective , and process ."
Research questions	"Affective and process conflicts have been consistently found to impede group performance ; however , the effect of task conflict is inconsistent ."
Research questions	"We propose that these inconclusive results are due to underspecification of the task conflict construct , and focus on the transition phase where task-related disagreements escalate into affective and process conflict ."
Research method	"We define these transitional phases as distinct constructstask-affective and task-process conflictand develop a theoretical model that explains how the various task-related conflict constructs , together with the composition of the wiki editor group , determine the quality of the collaboratively authored wiki article ."
Research method	"Our empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles involved multiple data-collection methods , including analysis of Wikipedia system logs , manual content analysis of articles ' discussion pages , and a comprehensive assessment of articles ' quality using the Delphi method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results show that when group members ' disagreementsoriginally task relatedescalate into personal attacks or hinge on procedure , these disagreements impede group performance ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Implications for research and practice are discussed .
Research questions	"We focus on influence tasks because , although they appear to be unfamiliar , they arise in much academic discourse , at least tacitly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We report the processes of academics at different levels of seniority when completing exploratory search tasks that involved identifying influential members of their academic community and rising stars , and similarly for an unfamiliar academic community ."
Research method	11 think-aloud sessions followed by semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the roles of specific and general domain expertise in shaping information seeking and knowledge construction .
Research method	"Academics defined and completed the tasks through an iterative and interactive process of seeking and sensemaking , during which they constructed an understanding of their communities and determined qualities of being influential ."
Research method	The Data/Frame Theory of Sensemaking was used to provide sensitising theoretical constructs .
Research findings/conclusions	"The study shows that both external and internal knowledge resources are essential to define a starting point or frame , make and support decisions , and experience satisfaction ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Ill-defined or non-existent initial frames may cause unsubstantial or arbitrary decisions , and feelings of uncertainty and lack of confidence ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Such file management has been the focus of many studies across various fields , but has not been explicitly acknowledged nor made the focus of dedicated review ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article we present the first dedicated review of this topic and its research , synthesizing more than 230 publications from various research domains to establish what is known and what remains to be investigated , particularly by examining the common motivations , methods , and Research findings/conclusions evinced by the previously furcate body of work ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find three typical research motivations in the literature reviewed : understanding how and why users store , organize , retrieve , and share files and folders , understanding factors that determine their behavior , and attempting to improve the user experience through novel interfaces and information services ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Relevant conceptual frameworks and approaches to designing and testing systems are described , and open research challenges and the significance for other research areas are discussed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We conclude that file management is a ubiquitous , challenging , and relatively unsupported activity that invites and has received attention from several disciplines and has broad importance for topics across information science ."
Research method	"Accordingly , we quantitatively represent the proportion of contributions from each author and reference to a paper ."
Research method	A paper 's credit can be allocated among its authors and references based on their contributions .
Research method	All papers carry innate credit because of publication .
Research findings/conclusions	"If cited , they also carry external credit from the citing papers ."
Research method	The proportion of a paper 's credit allocated to references can be regarded as a credit output and serves as an input for these references .
Research findings/conclusions	"In this scenario , only the credit assigned to a paper 's authors remains as the paper 's deserved credit ."
Research findings/conclusions	The credit of papers can be transferred in a direction opposite that of knowledge diffusion .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Via this method , the estimate of an individual reference 's contribution incorporates content-based citation analysis , a promising method to differentiate different citations ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	A paper 's deserved credit represents the contribution of the paper 's authors to the scientific community via the new knowledge they provide in the paper .
Research findings/conclusions	"Therefore , it is rational to evaluate papers according to their deserved credit , not the credit they carry ."
Research questions	Most solutions to this problem are typically based on increases or spikes in frequency of terms in social media .
Research questions	"In our case , we explore whether sudden changes in the positivity or negativity that keywords are typically associated with can be exploited for this Research questions ."
Research method	A data set that contains several million Twitter messages over a 1-month time span is presented and experimental results demonstrate that sentiment analysis can be successfully utilized for this Research questions .
Research findings/conclusions	Further experiments study the sensitivity of both frequency- or sentiment-based solutions to a number of parameters .
Research findings/conclusions	"Concretely , we show that the number of tweets that are used for event detection is an important factor , while the number of days used to extract token frequency or sentiment averages is not ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Lastly , we present results focusing on detecting local events and conclude that all approaches are dependant on the level of coverage that such events receive in social media ."
Research method	It involves 2 studies .
Research method	"In the first , a user-centered sound design method is used , based on one originally applied for visually impaired users ."
Research method	Three panels of end users are employed to collaboratively and iteratively design the required nonspeech sounds .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The method ensures that the sounds designed are not based on designers ' personal or ad hoc choices and instead exploits the creativity of a user group as an application of participatory sound design .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the results of this study , recommendations are made for extending the sound design method to novel interfaces and sighted users ."
Research method	A second study involves a formative evaluation of the information system integrated with the designed auditory feedback .
Research findings/conclusions	This evaluation confirms that the user-centered sound design method leads to the creation of auditory feedback which conveys meaningful information to users .
Research method	"In order to better understand and support the language preferences and behaviors of such multilingual users , this paper presents a series of five large-scale studies that specifically elicit language choices regarding search queries and result lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results from the studies indicate that users frequently make use of different languages ( i.e. , not just their primary language ) , especially when they are provided with choices ( e.g. , when provided with a secondary language query or result list choice ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , when presented with a mixed-language list choice , participants choose this option to an almost equal extent compared to primary-language-only lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Important factors leading to language choices are user- , task- and system-related , including proficiency , task topic , and result layout ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , participants ' subjective reasons for making particular choices indicate that their primary language is considered more comfortable , that the secondary language often has more relevant and trustworthy results , and that mixed-language lists provide a better overview ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"These results provide crucial insights into multilingual user preferences and behaviors , and may help in the design of systems that can better support the querying and result exploration of multilingual users ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study argues that collaboration networks can look more or less scale-free depending on the methods for resolving author name ambiguity in bibliographic data .
Research findings/conclusions	"Analyzing networks constructed from multiple datasets containing 3.4 M similar to 9.6 M publication records , this study shows that collaboration networks in which author names are disambiguated by the commonly used heuristic , i.e. , forename-initial-based name matching , tend to produce degree distributions better fitted to power-law slopes with the typical scaling parameter ( 2 < alpha < 3 ) than networks disambiguated by more accurate algorithm-based methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Such tendency is observed across collaboration networks generated under various conditions such as cumulative years , 5- and 1-year sliding windows , and random sampling , and through simulation , found to arise due mainly to artefactual entities created by inaccurate disambiguation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This cautionary study calls for special attention from scholars analyzing network data in which entities such as people , organization , and gene can be merged or split by improper disambiguation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Using primary research analysis of the number of images , references , internal links , external links , words , and characters , as well as their proportions in Good and Featured articles on the eight largest Wikipedias , we discover a high diversity of approaches and format preferences , correlating with culture ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We demonstrate that high-quality standards in information presentation are not globally shared and that in many aspects , the language culture 's influence determines what is perceived to be proper , desirable , and exemplary for encyclopedic entries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"As a result , we demonstrate that standards for encyclopedic knowledge are not globally agreed-upon and objective but local and very subjective ."
Research method	"In this article , the authors investigate the usage of structural information of scientific publications in both problems , and the consideration of citation evidence in the second problem ."
Research method	"Three statistical measures namely Inverse Generic Class Frequency , Spread , and Depth are introduced to assign a degree of importance ( i.e. , weight ) to structural components in scientific articles ."
Research method	"A term-weighting scheme is adjusted to incorporate component-weight factors , which is used to improve the retrieval of potential sources of plagiarism ."
Research method	"A plagiarism screening process is applied based on a measure of resemblance , in which component-weight factors are exploited to ignore less or nonsignificant plagiarism cases ."
Research method	"Using the notion of citation evidence , parts with proper citation evidence are excluded , and remaining cases are suspected and used to calculate the similarity index ."
Research method	"The authors compare their approach to two flat-based baselines , TF-IDF weighting with a Cosine coefficient , and shingling with a Jaccard coefficient ."
Research method	"In both baselines , they use different comparison units with overlapping measures for plagiarism screening ."
Research method	"They conducted extensive experiments using a dataset of 15,412 documents divided into 8,657 source publications and 6,755 suspicious queries , which included 18,147 plagiarism cases inserted automatically ."
Research method	"Component-weight factors are assessed using precision , recall , and F-measure averaged over a 10-fold cross-validation and compared using the ANOVA statistical test ."
Research method	"Results from structural-based candidate retrieval and plagiarism detection are evaluated statistically against the flat baselines using paired-t tests on 10-fold cross-validation runs , which demonstrate the efficacy achieved by the proposed framework ."
Research findings/conclusions	"An empirical study on the system 's response shows that structural information , unlike existing plagiarism detectors , helps to flag significant plagiarism cases , improve the similarity index , and provide human-like plagiarism screening results ."
Research questions	"Researchers using ASNSs come from very divergent scientific backgrounds and academic levels , prompting one to ask the question , What kind of communication and self-presentation behaviors occur within these structures ?"
Research method	The qualitative study presented in this article analyzed the communication behavior of a selected sample on ResearchGate ( RG ) .
Research questions	It investigates how researchers present themselves on their personal-profile sites and how they interact with other researchers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Overall , the results show that mostly young male academics without previous connections to each other ( for example , faculty colleges ) use RG for their scholarly exchanges ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In general , communication behavior is characterized by an objective , professional , unemotional choice of words and seldom the use of polite salutations or words of farewell ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , there seems to be a correlation between long discussion and an increased use of colloquial and emotional language ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on our Research findings/conclusions , we derived preliminary practical recommendations for communications on ASNSs to improve the relationships in online academic interactions , to foster inclusiveness of gender and culture , and to reduce insecurity in matters of communication , presentation , and the exchange of scientific data ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the click metrics of over 1.1 million Bitly short links referring to Web of Science ( WoS ) publications , our results show that around 49.5 % of them were not clicked by Twitter users ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For those Bitly short links with clicks from Twitter , the majority of their Twitter clicks accumulated within a short period of time after they were first tweeted ."
Research findings/conclusions	Bitly short links to the publications in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities tend to attract more clicks from Twitter over other subject fields .
Research questions	This article also assesses the extent to which Twitter clicks are correlated with some other impact indicators .
Research findings/conclusions	"Twitter clicks are weakly correlated with scholarly impact indicators ( WoS citations and Mendeley readers ) , but moderately correlated to other Twitter engagement indicators ( total retweets and total likes ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In light of these results , we highlight the importance of paying more attention to the click metrics of URLs in scholarly Twitter mentions , to improve our understanding about the more effective dissemination and reception of science information on Twitter ."
Research findings/conclusions	Public health professionals require good information about successful health promotion policies and programs that might be considered for application within their own communities .
Research questions	"Our effort seeks to improve access to relevant information for the public health profession , to help those in the field remain an information-savvy workforce ."
Research findings/conclusions	Natural language processing and semantic techniques hold promise to help public health professionals navigate the growing ocean of information by organizing and structuring this knowledge into a focused public health framework paired with a user-friendly visualization application as a way to summarize results of PubMed ( R ) searches in this field of knowledge .
Research findings/conclusions	"The VQR performance evaluation followed a pattern also seen in other nations , as it was based on a selected subset of products ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this work , we identify the exercise 's methodological weaknesses and measure the distortions that result from them in the university performance rankings ."
Research method	"First , we create a scenario in which we assume the efficient selection of the products to be submitted by the universities and , from this , simulate a set of rankings applying the precise VQR rating criteria ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Next , we compare these VQR rankings with those that would derive from the application of more-appropriate bibliometrics ."
Research method	"Finally , we extend the comparison to university rankings based on the entire scientific production for the period , as indexed in the Web of Science ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Such analyses have mainly been based upon hyperlink counts , the number of hyperlinks between a pair of websites , although some have used title mentions or URL citations instead ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The ability to automatically gather hyperlink counts from Yahoo !
Research findings/conclusions	"ceased in April 2011 and the ability to manually gather such counts was due to cease by early 2012 , creating a need for alternatives ."
Research method	This article assesses URL citations and title mentions as possible replacements for hyperlinks in both binary and weighted direct link and co-inlink network diagrams .
Research method	"It also assesses three different types of data for the network connections : hit count estimates , counts of matching URLs , and filtered counts of matching URLs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Results from analyses of U. S. library and information science departments and U. K. universities give evidence that metrics based upon URLs or titles can be appropriate replacements for metrics based upon hyperlinks for both binary and weighted networks , although filtered counts of matching URLs are necessary to give the best results for co-title mention and co-URL citation network diagrams ."
Research findings/conclusions	Data indicate that the smartphone adoption rates are beyond the early majority and are now approaching the late majority .
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions of analysis of variance tests revealed that all variables of TAM , VAM , and SI varied across the adopter groups : The current adopter 's mean values of the variables were the highest , followed by those of potential and nonadoption groups ."
Research findings/conclusions	Multinomial logistic regression ( MLR ) analyses revealed that perceived value and affiliation mainly determine the different perceptions of adoption groups .
Research findings/conclusions	"Smartphone adoption , however , was relatively unaffected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Perceived popularity , perceived price , and ethnicity played a role in distinctive determinants between current adopters and nonadopters ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results imply that adopters perceive smartphones as not only a worthwhile device in which to invest money but also a symbolic device to signal their affiliation and timely technology adoption .
Research findings/conclusions	Another intriguing finding is the differences of interest in contents between current adopters and nonadopters .
Research findings/conclusions	"Social interactions via social networking services , acquisition for lifestyle , information seeking , and entertainment via gaming were the main applications of interest ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our analysis reveals three main categories of need : needs around how to create a positive environment for a child , needs around a mother 's relationships and well-being and needs around child development and health ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	We demonstrate the similarities of this scheme to needs uncovered in other studies and how our classification of needs is more comprehensive than those in previous studies .
Research findings/conclusions	"A critical distinction in our results is between two types of need presentation , distinguishing between situational and informational needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	Situational needs are narrative descriptions of a problematic situations whereas informational needs are need statements with a clear request .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Distinguishing between these two types of needs sheds new light on how information needs develop .
Research questions	We conclude with a discussion on the implication of our results for young mothers and information providers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Here , however , we show that it is not so much a national bias , but that papers have a greater impact on their immediate environments , an impact that is diluted as that environment grows ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For this reason , the greatest biases are observed in countries with a limited production ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Papers that involve international collaboration have a greater impact in general , on the one hand , because they have multiple immediate environments , and on the other because of their greater quality or prestige ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In short , one can say that science knows no frontiers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Certainly there is a greater impact on the authors ' immediate environment , but this does not necessarily have to coincide with their national environments , which fade in importance as the collaborative environment expands ."
Research findings/conclusions	The ORM experts try to minimize the negative impact of the information about an entity while maximizing the positive material for being more trustworthy to the customers .
Research findings/conclusions	"Due to the huge amount of information that is published on the Internet every day , there is a need to summarize the entire flow of information to obtain only those data that are relevant to the entities ."
Research questions	"Traditionally the automatic summarization task in the ORM scenario takes some in-domain signals into account such as popularity , polarity for reputation and novelty but exists other feature to be considered , the authority of the people ."
Research questions	This authority depends on the ability to convince others and therefore to influence opinions .
Research questions	"In this work , we propose the use of authority signals that measures the influence of a user jointly with ( a ) priority signals related to the ORM domain and ( b ) information regarding the different topics that influential people is talking about ."
Research findings/conclusions	Our results indicate that the use of authority signals may significantly improve the quality of the summaries that are automatically generated .
Research method	"Using the Hierarchical Linear Modeling software package and the 2-wave data from 166 individuals in 51 wiki-based teams , we found cross-level interaction effects between individual epistemic motivation and team task reflexivity on different knowledge contribution behaviors on wikis ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Epistemic motivation exerted a positive effect on adding , which was strengthened by team task reflexivity ."
Research findings/conclusions	The effect of epistemic motivation on deleting was positive only when task reflexivity was high .
Research findings/conclusions	"In addition , epistemic motivation was strongly positively related to revising , regardless of the level of task reflexivity involved ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results indicate that textual similarity , intellectual overlap ( shared references ) , author overlap ( shared authors ) , proximity in publication time all rise monotonically as the cocitation level gets lower ( from journal to bracket ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While the main gain in similarity happens when moving from journal to article cocitation , all level changes entail an increase in similarity , especially section to paragraph and paragraph to sentence/bracket levels ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We compared the results from four journals over the years 2010-2015 : Cell , the European Journal of Operational Research , Physics Letters B , and Research Policy , with consistent general outcomes and some interesting differences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions motivate the use of granular cocitation information as defined by meaningful units of text , with implications for , among others , the elaboration of maps of science and the retrieval of scholarly literature ."
Research method	"This allows an analysis of how genre labels are applied , how genres are composed and how these ingredients change , and how genres compare ."
Research method	"We apply unsupervised topic modeling to a large collection of textual movie summaries and then use the model 's topic proportions to investigate key questions in genre , including recognizability , mapping , canonicity , and change over time ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that many genres can be quite easily predicted by their lexical signatures and this defines their position on the genre landscape .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find significant genre composition changes between periods for westerns , science fiction and road movies , reflecting changes in production and consumption values ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We show that in terms of canonicity , canonical examples are often at the high end of the topic distribution profile for the genre rather than central as might be predicted by categorization theory ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , author name ambiguity may lead to irrelevant retrieval results ."
Research method	"To improve the PubMed user experience with author name queries , we designed an author name disambiguation system consisting of similarity estimation and agglomerative clustering ."
Research method	A machine-learning method was employed to score the features for disambiguating a pair of papers with ambiguous names .
Research method	"These features enable the computation of pairwise similarity scores to estimate the probability of a pair of papers belonging to the same author , which drives an agglomerative clustering algorithm regulated by 2 factors : name compatibility and probability level ."
Research method	"With transitivity violation correction , high precision author clustering is achieved by focusing on minimizing false-positive pairing ."
Research method	Disambiguation performance is evaluated with manual verification of random samples of pairs from clustering results .
Research findings/conclusions	"When compared with a state-of-the-art system , our evaluation shows that among all the pairs the lumping error rate drops from 10.1 % to 2.2 % for our system , while the splitting error rises from 1.8 % to 7.7 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This results in an overall error rate of 9.9 % , compared with 11.9 % for the state-of-the-art method ."
Research findings/conclusions	Other evaluations based on gold standard data also show the increase in accuracy of our clustering .
Research findings/conclusions	We attribute the performance improvement to the machine-learning method driven by a large-scale training set and the clustering algorithm regulated by a name compatibility scheme preferring precision .
Research findings/conclusions	"With integration of the author name disambiguation system into the PubMed search engine , the overall click-through-rate of PubMed users on author name query results improved from 34.9 % to 36.9 % ."
Research questions	"However , in such environments , news variety and quantity can have an overwhelming effect ."
Research questions	New-event detection and topic-tracking studies address this problem .
Research findings/conclusions	"They examine news streams and organize stories according to their events ; however , several tracking stories of an event/topic may contain no new information ( i.e. , no novelty ) ."
Research questions	We study the novelty detection ( ND ) problem on the tracking news of a particular topic .
Research method	"For this Research questions , we build a Turkish ND test collection called BilNov-2005 and propose the usage of three ND methods : a cosine-similarity ( CS ) -based method , a language-model ( LM ) -based method , and a cover-coefficient ( CC ) -based method ."
Research findings/conclusions	"For the LM-based ND method , we show that a simpler smoothing approach , Dirichlet smoothing , can have similar performance to a more complex smoothing approach , Shrinkage smoothing ."
Research method	We introduce a baseline that shows the performance of a system with random novelty decisions .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , a category-based threshold learning method is used for the first time in ND literature ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The experimental results show that the LM-based ND method significantly outperforms the CS- and CC-based methods , and category-based threshold learning achieves promising results when compared to general threshold learning ."
Research questions	"We report on a study of the relationship between information searchers ' topic knowledge and their search behaviors , and on an attempt to predict searchers ' topic knowledge from their behaviors during the search ."
Research method	"Data were collected in a controlled laboratory experiment with 32 undergraduate journalism student participants , each searching on 4 tasks of different types ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In general , behavioral variables were not found to have significant differences between users with high and low levels of topic knowledge , except the mean first dwell time on search result pages ."
Research method	"Several models were built to predict topic knowledge using behavioral variables calculated at 3 different stages of search episodes : the first-query-round , the middle point of the search , and the end point ."
Research findings/conclusions	It was found that a model using some search behaviors observed in the first query round led to satisfactory prediction results .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results suggest that early-session search behaviors can be used to predict users ' topic knowledge levels , allowing personalization of search for users with different levels of topic knowledge , especially in order to assist users with low topic knowledge ."
Research method	Two related studies were conducted using hotel reviews as the test case for investigation .
Research method	"The first study analyzed 1,800 authentic and fictitious reviews based on the linguistic cues of comprehensibility , specificity , exaggeration , and negligence ."
Research method	The analysis involved classification algorithms followed by feature selection and statistical tests .
Research method	A filtered set of variables that helped discern review authenticity was identified .
Research findings/conclusions	The second study incorporated these variables to develop a guideline that aimed to inform humans how to distinguish between authentic and fictitious reviews .
Research method	The guideline was used as an intervention in an experimental setup that involved 240 participants .
Research findings/conclusions	The intervention improved human ability to identify fictitious reviews amid authentic ones .
Research method	An ethnographic approach incorporating both semistructured interviews and in the garage ethnographic observation was employed .
Research method	"Analysis was undertaken using an inductive , thematic approach ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions demonstrate that participants ' information environments are rich and complex .
Research findings/conclusions	"Participants ' accounts emphasized the corporeal and embodied nature of the restoration process , and this may account for why they privileged the social networks they had developed , often over many decades , over online resources and communities ."
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions indicate that participants are engaged in much more than applied problem solving .
Research findings/conclusions	"What is also evident is that engagement in the social world of car restoration , and the networks of social knowledge sharing it affords , is significant for the emotional support it provides for older men who often lose these networks later in life ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In a sense , the participants are not only rebuilding their cars but also their own sense of self ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We examine several relationships potentially associated with funding , including first citation , total citations , and the chances of becoming highly cited ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , we explore the links between citations and types of funding by organization and also with combined measures of funding ."
Research questions	"In particular , we examine the relationship between funding intensity and funding variety and citation ."
Research method	"Our empirical work focuses on six small advanced European economies , applying a zero inflated negative binomial model to a set of more than 240,000 papers authored by researchers from these countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	We find that funding is not related to the first citation but is significantly related to the number of citations and top percentile citation impact .
Research findings/conclusions	"Additionally , we find that citation impact is positively related to funding variety and negatively related with funding intensity ."
Research findings/conclusions	Finally there is an inverse relationship between the relative frequency of funding and citation impact .
Research findings/conclusions	The results presented in the paper provide insights for the design of research programs and the structure of research funding and for the behavior and strategies of research and sponsoring organizations .
Research questions	"Yet , contrary to initial expectations , cost of access to published scientific knowledge increased following the advent of the Internet and electronic processing ."
Research findings/conclusions	An analysis of the ethicality of current arrangements in academic publishing shows that monetization and the sequestering of scientific knowledge behind paywalls breach the principle of fairness and damage public interest .
Research findings/conclusions	"Following decades of failed effort to redress the situation , there are ethical grounds for consumers of scientific knowledge to invoke the right of collective civil disobedience , including support for pirate open access ."
Research questions	Could this be the best option available to consumers of scientific knowledge for removing paywalls to knowledge that rightly belongs in the public domain ?
Research value/outlook/limitations	A model that attempts to solve this has previously been presented .
Research findings/conclusions	"This model contained various baseline features , including contextual relationship features , statistical features , and language-specific features ."
Research method	The domain of Jewish law documents written in Hebrew and Aramaic is known to be rich in ambiguous abbreviations and therefore this model was implemented and applied over 2 separate corpuses within this domain .
Research method	Several common machine-learning ( ML ) methods were tested with the intent of finding a successful integration of the baseline feature variants .
Research findings/conclusions	"When the features were evaluated individually , the best averaged results were achieved by a library for support vector machines ( LIBSVM ) ; 98.07 % of the ambiguous abbreviations , which were researched in the domain , were disambiguated correctly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"When all the features were evaluated together , the J48 ML method achieved the best result , with 96.95 % accuracy ."
Research method	"In this paper , we examine the system 's degree of success and the degree of its professionalism by conducting a comparison between this system 's results and the results achieved by 39 participants , highly fluent in the research domain ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Despite the fact that all the participants had backgrounds in religious scriptures and continue to study these texts , the system 's accuracy rate , 98.07 % , was significantly higher than the average accuracy result of the participants , 91.65 % ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Further analysis of the results for each corpus implies that participants overcomplicate the required task , as well as exclude vital information needed to properly examine the context of a given initialism ."
Research method	The anonymized data set gathered from an opt-in system provides users ' approximate physical location as well as web browsing and some search history .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Such data provide a unique opportunity to analyze the interaction between people 's behavior in physical retail spaces and their web behavior , serving as a proxy to their information needs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We found that ( a ) there is a weekly periodicity in users ' visits to the mall ; ( b ) people tend to visit similar mall locations and web content during their repeated visits to the mall ; ( c ) around 60 % of registered Wi-Fi users actively browse the web , and around 10 % of them use Wi-Fi for accessing web search engines ; ( d ) people are likely to spend a relatively constant amount of time browsing the web while the duration of their visit may vary ; ( e ) the physical spatial context has a small , but significant , influence on the web content that indoor users browse ; and ( f ) accompanying users tend to access resources from the same web domains ."
Research questions	"Discapnet is a website mainly aimed at visually disabled people , and navigation is a challenging task for its users ."
Research questions	"In this context , system evaluation and problem detection become crucial aspects for enhancing user experience and may contribute greatly to diminishing the existing technological gap ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This study proposes a system based on web-mining techniques that collects in-use information while the user is accessing the web ( thus , being a noninvasive system ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed system models users in the wild and discovers navigation problems appearing in Discapnet and can also be used for problem detection when new users are navigating the site .
Research method	"The system was tested and its efficiency demonstrated in an experiment involving navigation under supervision , in which 82.6 % of a set of disabled people were automatically labeled as having problems with the website ."
Research questions	Author cocitation analysis using mapping techniques has been most frequently used to study how closely two authors are thought to be in intellectual space based on how members of the research community co-cite their works .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Other approaches exist to study author relatedness based more directly on the text of their published works .
Research method	"In this study we present static and dynamic word-based approaches using vector space modeling , as well as a topic-based approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation for mapping author research relatedness ."
Research method	Vector space modeling is used to define an author space consisting of works by a given author .
Research method	Outcomes for the two word-based approaches and a topic-based approach for 50 prolific authors in library and information science are compared with more traditional author cocitation analysis using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis .
Research findings/conclusions	The two word-based approaches produced similar outcomes except where two authors were frequent co-authors for the majority of their articles .
Research findings/conclusions	The topic-based approach produced the most distinctive map .
Research method	He derived this relationship from two assumptions : that words follow Zipf 's law for word frequencies ( a power law dependency between frequency and rank ) and Zipf 's law of meaning distribution ( a power law dependency between number of meanings and rank ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Here we show that a single assumption on the joint probability of a word and a meaning suffices to infer Zipf 's meaning-frequency law or relaxed versions .
Research findings/conclusions	"Interestingly , this assumption can be justified as the outcome of a biased random walk in the process of mental exploration ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This research dissects the concept of orthogonality , in particular regard to music classification ."
Research questions	Orthogonality ( antonym : dependency ) means that one facet acts independently from another facet .
Research questions	"Although orthogonality is an assumed quality of facets , it has attracted relatively little attention in knowledge organization discourse ."
Research method	"This research utilizes bibliographic classification schemes , musicological writings , and musical works to analyze orthogonality in music classification ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The relationships between the medium , form/genre , and function facets are unpicked and a strong dependency is found between these facets ."
Research questions	Whether this orthogonality exists as a construct of faceted classification or stems from the domain knowledge is explored .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Furthermore , the analysis initiates new thinking about the general concept of orthogonality ."
Research findings/conclusions	The idea of a spectrum of dependency is proposed .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In addition , novel , orthogonality-derived phenomena are discussed-dynamic facets and meta-dependency-where the boundary between what is and is not a facet is blurred ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The concluding model visualizes the chain of dependencies between music facets , ultimately showing how the lack of orthogonality plays a key role in the complexity and issues found in music classification ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this work , we provide a detailed characterization of such queries and show that search engines try to improve such queries by showing the results of related queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Through a user study , we show that these query suggestions are usually perceived as relevant ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Also , through a query log analysis , we show that the users are dissatisfied after submitting a query that match no results at least 88.5 % of the time ."
Research questions	"As a first step towards solving these no-answer queries , we devised a large number of features that can be used to identify such queries and built machine-learning models ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These models can be useful for scenarios such as the mobile- or meta-search , where identifying a query that will retrieve no results at the client device ( i.e. , even before submitting it to the search engine ) may yield gains in terms of the bandwidth usage , power consumption , and/or monetary costs ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments over query logs indicate that , despite the heavy skew in class sizes , our models achieve good prediction quality , with accuracy ( in terms of area under the curve ) up to 0.95 ."
Research method	"Using both resources , we have created a unique relational database designed to compare citation counts to books with international library holdings or libcitations for scholarly book publishers ."
Research method	"First , we construct a ranking of the top 500 publishers and explore descriptive statistics at the level of publisher type ( university , commercial , other ) and country of origin ."
Research method	We then identify the top 50 university presses and commercial houses based on total citations and mean citations per book ( CPB ) .
Research method	"In a third analysis , we present a map of directed citation links between journals and book publishers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"American and British presses/publishing houses tend to dominate the work of library collection managers and citing scholars ; however , a number of specialist publishers from Europe are included ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Distinct clusters from the directed citation map indicate a certain degree of regionalism and subject specialization , where some journals produced in languages other than English tend to cite books published by the same parent press ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Bibliometric rankings convey only a small part of how the actual structure of the publishing field has evolved ; hence , challenges lie ahead for developers of new citation indices for books and bibliometricians interested in measuring book and publisher impacts ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals ?
Research method	"In addition to the 2-year IF ( IF2 ) , we consider the 5-year IF ( IF5 ) , the respective numerators of these IFs , and the number of Total Cites , counted both as integers and fractionally ."
Research method	These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/NSF ( National Science Foundation ) provides statistically significant between-field effects .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7 % in the case of IF5 , and by 79.2 % in the case of IF2 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting ."
Research findings/conclusions	"These results accord with previous studies , but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Even though online book-exchange systems have been developed , their services can further be improved by reducing the workload imposed on their users ."
Research questions	"To accomplish this task , we propose a recommendation-based book exchange system , called EasyEx , which identifies potential exchanges for a user solely based on a list of items the user is willing to part with ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"EasyEx is a novel and unique book-exchange system because unlike existing online exchange systems , it does not require a user to create and maintain a wish list , which is a list of items the user would like to receive as part of the exchange ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Instead , EasyEx directly suggests items to users to increase serendipity and as a result expose them to items which may be unfamiliar , but appealing , to them ."
Research method	"In identifying books to be exchanged , EasyEx employs known recommendation strategies , that is , personalized mean and matrix factorization , to predict book ratings , which are treated as the degrees of appeal to a user on recommended books ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , EasyEx incorporates OptaPlanner , which solves constraint satisfaction problems efficiently , as part of the recommendation-based exchange process to create exchange cycles ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experimental results have verified that EasyEx offers users recommended books that satisfy the users ' interests and contributes to the item-exchange mechanism with a new design methodology .
Research questions	"Earlier works identified result diversification as a useful technique to support learning-oriented search , since diversification ensures a comprehensive coverage of various aspects of the queried topic in the result list ."
Research questions	"Inspired by this finding , first we define a new research problem , multidimensional result diversification , in the context of educational search ."
Research questions	"We argue that in a search engine for the education domain , it is necessary to diversify results across multiple dimensions , that is , not only for the topical aspects covered by the retrieved documents , but also for other dimensions , such as the type of the document ( e.g. , text , video , etc . )"
Research findings/conclusions	"or its intellectual level ( say , for beginners/experts ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , we propose a framework that extends the probabilistic and supervised diversification methods to take into account the coverage of such multiple dimensions ."
Research method	We demonstrate its effectiveness upon a newly developed test collection based on a real-life educational search engine .
Research findings/conclusions	Thorough experiments based on gathered relevance annotations reveal that the proposed framework outperforms the baseline by up to 2.4 % .
Research findings/conclusions	An alternative evaluation utilizing user clicks also yields improvements of up to 2 % w.r.t .
Research findings/conclusions	various metrics .
Research questions	"In recent years , research in this field has grown rapidly ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the performance of state-of-the-art methods is heavily affected when text of known authorship and texts under investigation differ in topic and/or genre ."
Research questions	"So far , it is not clear how to quantify the personal style of authors in a way that is not affected by topic shifts or genre variations ."
Research method	"In this paper , a set of text distortion methods are used attempting to mask topic-related information ."
Research method	These methods transform the input texts into a more topic-neutral form while maintaining the structure of documents associated with the personal style of the author .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using a controlled corpus that includes a fine-grained range of topics and genres it is demonstrated how the proposed approach can be combined with existing authorship attribution methods to enhance their performance in very challenging tasks , especially in cross-topic attribution ."
Research questions	"We also examine cross-genre attribution and the most challenging , yet realistic , cross-topic-and-genre attribution scenarios and show how the proposed techniques should be tuned to enhance performance in these tasks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we demonstrate that there are important differences in attribution effectiveness when either conversational genres , nonconversational genres , or a mix of them are considered ."
Research findings/conclusions	Some texts are more ephemeral than others .
Research questions	The web has proved to be among the most ephemeral and changing of information vehicles .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The research note revisits Koehler 's original data set after about 20 years since it was first collected .
Research findings/conclusions	"By late 2013 , the number of URLs responding to a query had fallen to 1.6 % of the original sample ."
Research findings/conclusions	A query of the 6 remaining URLs in February 2015 showed only 2 still responding .
Research questions	"In this context and given that university libraries have played an important role in supporting RDM at an institutional level in North America , Europe , and Australasia , the aim of this article is to explore the current status of RDM in Chinese universities , in particular how university libraries have been involved in taking the agenda forward ."
Research method	This article uses a mixed-methods data collection approach and draws on a website analysis of university policies and services ; a questionnaire for university librarians ; and semi-structured interviews .
Research findings/conclusions	Research findings/conclusions indicate that Research Data Service at a local level in Chinese Universities are in their infancy .
Research findings/conclusions	There is more evidence of activity in developing data repositories than support services .
Research findings/conclusions	There is little development of local policy .
Research findings/conclusions	"Among the explanations of this may be the existence of a national-level infrastructure for some subject disciplines , the lack of professionalization of librarianship , and the relatively weak resonance of openness as an idea in the Chinese context ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Accordingly , topic modeling in a network of documents has been attracting continuous research attention ."
Research questions	Most of the existing network-based topic models assume that topics in a document are influenced by its directly linked neighbouring documents in a document network and overlook the potential influence from indirectly linked ones .
Research value/outlook/limitations	The existing work also has not carefully modeled variations of such influence among neighboring documents .
Research questions	"Recognizing these modeling limitations , this paper introduces a novel Local Context-Aware LDA Model ( LC-LDA ) , which is capable of observing a local context comprising a rich collection of documents that may directly or indirectly influence the topic distributions of a target document ."
Research findings/conclusions	The proposed model can also differentiate the respective influence of each document in the local context on the target document according to both structural and temporal relationships between the two documents .
Research method	The proposed model is extensively evaluated through multiple document clustering and classification tasks conducted over several large-scale document sets .
Research findings/conclusions	Evaluation results clearly and consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the new model with respect to several state-of-the-art peer models .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , to date very little research has taken place on information and sustainable development in general , and on the environmental impact of information services in particular ."
Research questions	"Based on the data collected from various research papers and reports , this review article shows that information systems and services for the higher education and research sector currently generate massive greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , and it is argued that there is an urgent need for developing a green information service , or green IS in short , that should be based on minimum GHG emissions throughout its lifecycle , from content creation to distribution , access , use , and disposal ."
Research method	"Based on an analysis of the current research on green information technology ( IT ) , it is proposed that a green IS should be based on the model of cloud computing ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , a research agenda is proposed that will pave the way for building and managing green ISs to support education and research/scholarly activities ."
Research findings/conclusions	The frequency distribution of disciplines by citing articles provides a signature for a cited journal that permits it to be compared with other journals using similarity comparison techniques .
Research method	"As an initial exploration , citing discipline data for 40 high-impact-factor journals assigned to the information science and library science category of the Web of Science were compared across 5 time periods ."
Research method	Similarity relationships were determined using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the outcomes produced by the proposed citing discipline and established cocitation methods .
Research findings/conclusions	The maps and clustering outcomes reveal that a number of journals in allied areas of the information science and library science category may not be very closely related to each other or may not be appropriately situated in the category studied .
Research findings/conclusions	The citing discipline similarity data resulted in similar outcomes with the cocitation data but with some notable differences .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Because the citing discipline method relies on a citing perspective different from cocitations , it may provide a complementary way to compare journal similarity that is less labor intensive than cocitation analysis ."
Research method	"Drawing on social capital theories , we develop a theoretical model to investigate how the two types of social capital ( bonding and bridging ) contribute to the individual and collective well-being of virtual communities through information exchange ."
Research method	Research hypotheses were tested through survey instruments and computer archive data of 475 members of a large social network site during the Wenchuan earthquake ( 2008 ) in China .
Research findings/conclusions	We find that bonding has a positive and significant impact on bridging .
Research findings/conclusions	"Both bonding and bridging have positive and significant impacts on information quality , but not on information quantity ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results also suggest that information quality is more critical to individuals and collective well-being than information quantity after a disaster .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"With a focus on the social sciences , this article contributes to the existing literature on indicators and metrics use in fields with diverse publication practices ."
Research method	Scholars in Australia and Sweden were asked about their use and reasons for using metrics .
Research method	"A total of 581 completed surveys were analyzed to generate descriptive statistics , with textual analysis performed on comments provided to open questions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"While just under half of the participant group had used metrics , the Australians reported use in twice the proportion of their Swedish peers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Institutional policies and processes were frequently associated with use , and the scholars ' comments suggest a high level of awareness of some metrics as well as strategic behavior in demonstrating research performance ."
Research findings/conclusions	There is also evidence of tensions between scholars ' research evaluation environment and their disciplinary values and publication practices .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , this study considers the relationship between source credibility and argument quality and the relationship between herding factors and information usefulness ( i.e. , bias effects ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , this study proposes the interaction effects of source credibility and argument quality and the interaction effects of herding factors and information usefulness ( i.e. , synergistic effects ) ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Third , this study explores the moderating role of an information characteristic - search versus experience information ( i.e. , information contingency effects ) ."
Research method	"The proposed extended information adoption model ( EIAM ) is empirically tested through a 2 by 2 by 2 experiment in the social Q & A context , and the results confirm most of the hypotheses ."
Research method	"Finally , theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Odds and odds ratios can be used to measure the performance difference between a selected university and competing institutions , or the average of selected competitors , in a relatively simple but clear way ."
Research method	"To address this issue , the Game Metadata Research Group at the University of Washington Information School , in collaboration with the Seattle Interactive Media Museum , worked to create a standardized metadata schema ."
Research method	"This metadata schema was empirically evaluated using multiple approachescollaborative review , schema testing , semi-structured user interview , and a large-scale survey ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Reviewing and testing the schema revealed issues and challenges in sourcing the metadata for particular elements , determining the level of granularity for data description , and describing digitally distributed games ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions from user studies suggest that users value various subject and visual metadata , information about how games are related to each other , and data regarding game expansions/alterations such as additional content and networked features ."
Research method	"The metadata schema was extensively revised based on the evaluation results , and we present the new element definitions from the revised schema in this article ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work will serve as a platform and catalyst for advances in the design and use of video game metadata .
Research findings/conclusions	Numerous studies reported uncovering rich information and methodological advances .
Research questions	"However , very few studies thus far examined hyperlinks in the rapidly developing sphere of social media ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper reports a study that helps fill this gap .
Research method	"The study analyzed links originating from tweets to the websites of 3 types of organizations ( government , education , and business ) ."
Research method	Data were collected over an 8-month period to observe the fluctuation and reliability of the individual data set .
Research method	Hyperlink data from the general web ( not social media sites ) were also collected and compared with social media data .
Research findings/conclusions	The study found that the 2 types of hyperlink data correlated significantly and that analyzing the 2 together can help organizations see their relative strength or weakness in the two platforms .
Research findings/conclusions	The study also found that both types of inlink data correlated with offline measures of organizations ' performance .
Research findings/conclusions	Twitter data from a relatively short period were fairly reliable in estimating performance measures .
Research findings/conclusions	The timelier nature of social media data as well as the date/time stamps on tweets make this type of data potentially more valuable than that from the general web .
Research questions	"Having an established record of the use of a unique mixture of empirical methods , the work of understanding and designing for user behavior is well situated to take advantage of the advances claimed by big data methods ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Beyond any straightforward benefit of the use of large sets of data , such an increase in the scale of empirical evidence has far-reaching implications for the work of empirically guided design ."
Research questions	"We develop the concept of peak empiricism to explain the new role that large-scale data comes to play in design , one in which data become more than a simple empirical tool ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In providing such an expansive empirical setting for design , big data weakens the subjective conditions necessary for empirical insight , pointing to a more performative approach to the relationship between a designer and his or her work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this , the work of design is characterized as thinking with the data in a partnership that weakens not only any sense of empiricism but also the agentive foundations of a classical view of design work ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We present a novel , entirely unsupervised , method that achieves strong results on multiple testbeds , including those for which authorial threads are topically identical ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Unlike previous work , our method requires no specialized linguistic tools and can be easily applied to any text ."
Research questions	"We propose a novel flexible template generation and matching scheme called the principle-based approach ( PBA ) based on sequence alignment , and employ it for reference metadata extraction ( RME ) to demonstrate its effectiveness ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The main contributions of this research are threefold .
Research findings/conclusions	"First , we propose an automatic template generation that can capture prominent patterns using the dominating set algorithm ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Second , we devise an alignment-based template-matching technique that uses a logistic regression model , which makes it more general and flexible than pure rule-based approaches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Last , we apply PBA to RME on extensive cross-domain corpora and demonstrate its robustness and generality ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Experiments reveal that the same set of templates produced by the PBA framework not only deliver consistent performance on various unseen domains , but also surpass hand-crafted knowledge ( templates ) ."
Research method	We use four independent journal style test sets and one conference style test set in the experiments .
Research findings/conclusions	"When compared to renowned machine learning methods , such as conditional random fields ( CRF ) , as well as recent deep learning methods ( i.e. , bi-directional long short-term memory with a CRF layer , Bi-LSTM-CRF ) , PBA has the best performance for all datasets ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The factors include journal impact factor , individual collaboration , international collaboration , institution prestige , country prestige , research funding , abstract readability , abstract length , title length , number of cited references , field size , and field type and will be modeled in association with citation counts , Mendeley readers , Twitter posts , Facebook posts , blog posts , and news posts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts , seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers , eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts , three factors are important for increased Facebook posts , six factors are important for increased blog posts , and five factors are important for increased news posts ."
Research findings/conclusions	Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"However , the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors ; for instance , institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts , but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The Research findings/conclusions contribute to the continued development of theoretical models and methodological developments associated with capturing , interpreting , and understanding altmetric events ."
Research method	"Using a mixed-methods approach involving focus group interviews with 120 participants , an online survey with 2,918 responses , and an analysis of transaction logs of approximately 15 million sessions from , the study provides a new understanding of the context for global union catalog use ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that is accessed by a diverse population , with the three primary user groups being librarians , students , and academics ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Use of the system is found to fall within three broad types of work-task ( professional , academic , and leisure ) , and we also present an emergent taxonomy of search tasks that encompass known-item , unknown-item , and institutional information searches ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results support the notion that union catalogs are primarily used for known-item searches , although the volume of traffic to means that unknown-item searches nonetheless represent an estimated 250,000 sessions per month ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Search engine referrals account for almost half of all traffic , but although effectively connects users referred from institutional library catalogs to other libraries holding a sought item , users arriving from a search engine are less likely to connect to a library ."
Research findings/conclusions	These systems enable users to explore collections by way of latent topics .
Research method	A standard way to represent a topic is using a term list ; that is the top-n words with highest conditional probability within the topic .
Research findings/conclusions	Other topic representations such as textual and image labels also have been proposed .
Research questions	"However , there has been no comparison of these alternative representations ."
Research method	"In this article , we compare 3 different topic representations in a document retrieval task ."
Research method	"Participants were asked to retrieve relevant documents based on predefined queries within a fixed time limit , presenting topics in one of the following modalities : ( a ) lists of terms , ( b ) textual phrase labels , and ( c ) image labels ."
Research findings/conclusions	Results show that textual labels are easier for users to interpret than are term lists and image labels .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , the precision of retrieved documents for textual and image labels is comparable to the precision achieved by representing topics using term lists , demonstrating that labeling methods are an effective alternative topic representation ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Casual observations suggested that similar problematic papers are still published and sold , without follow-up retractions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	No systematic screening has been performed and the prevalence of such nonsensical publications in the scientific literature is unknown .
Research value/outlook/limitations	Our contribution is 2-fold .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"First , we designed a detector that combs the scientific literature for grammar-based computer-generated papers ."
Research method	"Applied to SCIgen , it has a 83.6 % precision ."
Research method	"Second , we performed a scientometric study of the 243 detected SCIgen-papers from 19 publishers ."
Research findings/conclusions	We estimate the prevalence of SCIgen-papers to be 75 per million papers in Information and Computing Sciences .
Research findings/conclusions	Only 19 % of the 243 problematic papers were dealt with : formal retraction ( 12 ) or silent removal ( 34 ) .
Research findings/conclusions	Publishers still serve and sometimes sell the remaining 197 papers without any caveat .
Research findings/conclusions	We found evidence of citation manipulation via edited SCIgen bibliographies .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This work reveals metric gaming up to the point of absurdity : fraudsters publish nonsensical algorithmically generated papers featuring genuine references .
Research findings/conclusions	It stresses the need to screen papers for nonsense before peer-review and chase citation manipulation in published papers .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Overall , this is yet another illustration of the harmful effects of the pressure to publish or perish ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Community management has three main Research questionss : to create a positive experience for existing participants , to promote appropriate , socionormative behaviors , and to encourage potential participants to make contributions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research indicates that the quality of content a potential participant sees on a site is highly influential ; off-topic , negative comments with malicious intent are a particularly strong boundary to participation or set the tone for encouraging similar contributions ."
Research questions	"Aproblem for community managers , therefore , is the detection and elimination of such undesirable content ."
Research questions	"As a community grows , this undertaking becomes more daunting ."
Research questions	Can an automated system aid community managers in this task ?
Research method	"In this paper , we address this question through a machine learning approach to automatic detection of inappropriate negative user contributions ."
Research method	Our training corpus is a set of comments from a news commenting site that we tasked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers with labeling .
Research method	"Each comment is labeled for the presence of profanity , insults , and the object of the insults ."
Research method	Support vector machines trained on these data are combined with relevance and valence analysis systems in a multistep approach to the detection of inappropriate negative user contributions .
Research findings/conclusions	The system shows great potential for semiautomated community management .
Research questions	"Although the quantity of digitized historical documents available is increasing , historians ' ways of working with the digital documents have not been widely studied , particularly in authentic work settings ."
Research questions	"To better support the historians ' reasoning processes , we investigate history researchers ' work tasks as the context of information interaction and examine their cognitive access points into information ."
Research method	The analysis is based on a longitudinal observational research and interviews in a task-based research setting .
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these Research findings/conclusions in the historians ' cognitive space , we build bridges into the document space ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"By studying the information interactions in real task contexts , we facilitate the provision of task-specific handles into documents that can be used in designing digital research tools for historians ."
Research findings/conclusions	They therefore tend not to disclose data that would be useful for personalization .
Research questions	We investigate how characteristics of the personalization provider influence users ' attitudes towards personalization and their resulting disclosure behavior .
Research method	We propose an integrative model that links these characteristics via privacy attitudes to actual disclosure behavior .
Research method	"Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model , we discuss in what way the influence of the manipulated provider characteristics is different for users engaging in different levels of elaboration ( represented by the user characteristics of privacy concerns and self-efficacy ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find particularly that ( a ) reputation management is effective when users predominantly use the peripheral route ( i.e. , a low level of elaboration ) , but much less so when they predominantly use the central route ( i.e. , a high level of elaboration ) ; ( b ) client-side personalization has a positive impact when users use either route ; and ( c ) personalization in the cloud does not work well in either route ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Managers and designers can use our results to instill more favorable privacy attitudes and increase disclosure , using different techniques that depend on each user 's levels of privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy ."
Research method	This paper describes a sociotechnical study conducted from 2008 through 2015 to identify deceptive communicative intent within group context as manifested in language-action cues .
Research method	"Specifically , this study used an online team-based game that simulates real-world deceptive insider scenarios to examine several dimensions of group communication ."
Research questions	"First , we studied how language-action cues differ between groups with and groups without a compromised actor ."
Research questions	We also examine how these cues differ within groups in terms of the group members ' individual and collective interactions with the compromised actor .
Research questions	"Finally , we look at how the cues of compromised actors differ from those of noncompromised actors , and how communication behavior changes after an actor is presented with an ethical dilemma ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results of the study further our understanding of language-action cues as indicators for unmasking a potential deceptive insider .
Research findings/conclusions	"However , such networks can vary according to the collection of data sets relevant to the theme by querying knowledge entities ."
Research method	In this study we classify three different bibliometric content networks .
Research method	"The primary bibliometric network is based on knowledge entities relevant to a keyword of the theme , the secondary network is based on entities associated with the lower concepts of the keyword , and the tertiary network is based on entities influenced by the theme ."
Research method	"To explore the content and properties of these networks , we propose a tomographic content analysis that takes a slice-and-dice approach to analyzing the networks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions indicate that the primary network is best suited to understanding the current knowledge on a certain topic , whereas the secondary network is good at discovering new knowledge across fields associated with the topic , and the tertiary network is appropriate for outlining the current knowledge of the topic and relevant studies ."
Research findings/conclusions	Additional sociotechnical challenges include items such as how to define the project goals and how to ensure the project is effectively managed .
Research method	"This paper reports on a set of case studies where researchers were embedded within data science teams and where the researcher observations and analysis was focused on the attributes that can help describe data science projects and the challenges faced by the teams executing these projects , as opposed to the algorithms and technologies that were used to perform the analytics ."
Research method	"Based on our case studies , we identified 14 characteristics that can help describe a data science project ."
Research method	We then used these characteristics to create a model that defines two key dimensions of the project .
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , by clustering the projects within these two dimensions , we identified four types of data science projects , and based on the type of project , we identified some of the sociotechnical challenges that project teams should expect to encounter when executing data science projects ."
Research findings/conclusions	It has proved to be a useful technology because it is able to improve retrieval performance frequently .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"However , in almost all prior research in data fusion , static search environments have been used , and dynamic search environments have generally not been considered ."
Research questions	"In this article , we investigate adaptive data fusion methods that can change their behavior when the search environment changes ."
Research method	Three adaptive data fusion methods are proposed and investigated .
Research method	"To test these proposed methods properly , we generate a benchmark from a historic Text REtrieval Conference data set ."
Research findings/conclusions	Experiments with the benchmark show that 2 of the proposed methods are good and may potentially be used in practice .
Research method	"In this study , we compare Mendeley readership counts with citations for different social sciences and humanities disciplines ."
Research findings/conclusions	The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities .
Research findings/conclusions	Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact .
Research method	Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields .
Research findings/conclusions	Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences .
Research findings/conclusions	"Thus , the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines , especially for people that read but do not author articles , as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts ."
Research method	"A collection of 8,310 tags from a digital portal ( Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship , NINES ) was analyzed to find out what attributes of primary historical resources users described with tags ."
Research method	"Tags were categorized to identify which tags describe the content of the resource , the resource itself , and subjective aspects ( e.g. , usage or emotion ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study 's Research findings/conclusions revealed that over half were content-related ; tags representing opinion , usage context , or self-reference , however , reflected only a small percentage ."
Research findings/conclusions	The study further found that terms related to genre or physical format of a resource were frequently used in describing primary archival resources .
Research findings/conclusions	"It was also learned that nontextual resources had lower numbers of content-related tags and higher numbers of document-related tags than textual resources and bibliographic materials ; moreover , textual resources tended to have more user-context-related tags than other resources ."
Research findings/conclusions	These Research findings/conclusions help explain users ' tagging behavior and resource interpretation in primary resources in the humanities .
Research findings/conclusions	"Such information provided through tags helps information professionals decide to what extent indexing archival and cultural resources should be done for resource description and discovery , and understand users ' terminology ."
Research questions	Some authors have argued that these differences could be explained by age-related decline .
Research questions	"The present study aimed to analyze the relationship between web-searching navigation and users & apos ; age , considering the Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) and frequency of Internet and personal computer use ."
Research questions	"The intent was to identify differences due to age and not to other variables ( that is , cognitive decline , expertise with the tool ) ."
Research method	Eighteen students ( 18-30 years ) and 18 older adults ( 60-75 years ) took part in the experiment .
Research method	Inclusion criteria were the frequent use of computers and a web-searching activity ; the older adults performed the Mini-Mental State Examination to exclude cognitive impairment .
Research method	Participants were requested to perform the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2 ( nd ) ed .
Research method	"to measure their IQ level , and nine everyday web-searching tasks of differing complexity ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results showed that older participants spent more time on solving tasks than younger participants , but with the same accuracy as young people ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , nonverbal IQ improved performance in terms of time among the older participants ."
Research findings/conclusions	Age did not influence web-searching behavior in users with normal expertise and intelligence .
Research findings/conclusions	"Moreover , there typically exists rich complementary information that can be delivered to the visitor about exhibits of interest , but only a fraction of this information can be consumed during the limited time of the visit ."
Research findings/conclusions	Recommender systems may help visitors to cope with this information overload .
Research findings/conclusions	"Ideally , the recommender system of choice should model user preferences , as well as background knowledge about the museum 's environment , considering aspects of physical and thematic relevancy ."
Research method	"We propose a personalized graph-based recommender framework , representing rating history and background multi-facet information jointly as a relational graph ."
Research method	"A random walk measure is applied to rank available complementary multimedia presentations by their relevancy to a visitor 's profile , integrating the various dimensions ."
Research method	We report the results of experiments conducted using authentic data collected at the Hecht museum .
Research findings/conclusions	"1 An evaluation of multiple graph variants , compared with several popular and state-of-theart recommendation methods , indicates on advantages of the graph-based approach ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most research , however , focuses on quantity and citation-based indicators ."
Research method	"Using the turnover of keywords , this study develops an integrative approach , tracking and visualizing the shift of the research stream , and tests it within the context of U.S.-China collaboration in nanotechnology ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results show evidence in support of the linkage between the emergence of a new research stream of Chinese researchers when there is U.S.-China collaboration .
Research findings/conclusions	We also find that the triggered research stream diffused further via extended coauthorship .
Research questions	Policy implications for science and technology development and resource allocation in the United States and China are discussed .
Research questions	The aim was to understand how fiction readers with varied reading preferences are selecting interesting novels in library catalogs .
Research method	We conducted a controlled user study with 80 participants .
Research method	Two reader groups were elicited according to similar reading preference patterns .
Research findings/conclusions	"The readers enjoyed the entertainment , escape , and comfort that reading as a pleasurable activity offered ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The aesthetic readers valued the artistic and aesthetic pleasures , widening vocabulary , and ability to express oneself through fiction books ."
Research method	We compared the search queries and search actions between the 2 reader groups .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results demonstrated that preference patterns were associated with readers ' search behavior , that is , the number of viewed search result pages , opened book pages , dwell time on book pages , and the type of search queries ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on the Research findings/conclusions , we present 3 search tactics for fiction books in library catalogs : i ) focused querying , ii ) topical browsing , and iii ) similarity-based tactic ."
Research findings/conclusions	The most popular search tactic in each search scenario was focused querying with known author in both reader groups .
Research questions	Do abstracts tend to use conceptually broader terms than sentences in a citation context in the body of a publication ?
Research questions	"In this article , we propose a method to analyze and compare latent topics in scientific publications , in particular , from abstracts of papers that cited a target reference and from sentences that cited the target reference ."
Research method	We conducted an experiment and applied topical modeling techniques to full-text papers in eight biomedicine journals .
Research method	Topics derived from the two sources are compared in terms of their similarities and broad-narrow relationships defined based on information entropy .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that abstracts and citation contexts are characterized by distinct sets of topics with moderate overlaps .
Research findings/conclusions	"Furthermore , the results confirm that topics from abstracts of citing papers have broader terms than topics from citation contexts formed by citing sentences ."
Research findings/conclusions	The method and the Research findings/conclusions could be used to enhance and extend the current methodologies for research evaluation and citation evaluation .
Research questions	"It notes that information science/IR has been evolving from a case science into a fully fledged , disciplined/disciplinary science ."
Research method	"The article establishes correspondences between linguistics and information science/IR using the three established IR paradigms-physical , cognitive , and computational-as a frame of reference ."
Research method	"The current relationship between information science/IR and linguistics is elucidated through discussion of some recent information science publications dealing with linguistic topics and a novel technique , keyword collocation analysis , is introduced ."
Research method	Insights from interdisciplinarity research and case theory are also discussed .
Research findings/conclusions	"It is demonstrated that the three stages of interdisciplinarity , namely multidisciplinarity , interdisciplinarity ( in the narrow sense ) , and transdisciplinarity , can be linked to different phases of the information science/IR-linguistics relationship and connected to different ways of using linguistic theory in information science and IR ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Current research has primarily focused on examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational or other settings and developing technical approaches to support CIS activities .
Research findings/conclusions	"As we continue to develop a better understanding of the interactional aspects of CIS , we need also start to examine the cognitive aspects of CIS ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In particular , we need to understand CIS from a team cognition perspective ."
Research method	"To examine how team cognition develops during CIS , we conducted a study using observations and interviews of student teams engaged in colocated CIS tasks in a laboratory setting ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that a variety of awareness mechanisms play a key role in the development of team cognition during CIS .
Research questions	"Specifically , we identify that search , information , and social methods of awareness are critical to developing team cognition during CIS ."
Research questions	"We discuss why awareness is important for team cognition , how team cognition comprises both individual and team-level cognitive activities , and the importance of examining both interaction and cognition to truly understand team cognition ."
Research findings/conclusions	"To take full advantage of the web as a research resource that extends beyond the consideration of snapshots of the present , however , it is necessary to begin to take web archiving much more seriously as an important element of any research program involving web resources ."
Research findings/conclusions	The ephemeral character of the web requires that researchers take proactive steps in the present to enable future analysis .
Research questions	"Efforts to archive the web or portions thereof have been developed around the world , but these efforts have not yet provided reliable and scalable solutions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This article summarizes the current state of web archiving in relation to researchers and research needs .
Research method	"Interviews with researchers , archivists , and technologists identify the differences in Research questions , scope , and scale of current web archiving practice , and the professional tensions that arise given these differences ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Research findings/conclusions outline the challenges that still face researchers who wish to engage seriously with web content as an object of research , and archivists who must strike a balance reflecting a range of user needs ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Much of the research that approaches information behavior from this perspective , however , has focused on static contexts or virtual contexts and has not addressed the influence of technology in physical spaces ."
Research questions	"In this article , we explore the influence of mobile technologies in two settings ."
Research method	"The first is a site where a social space was augmented by the introduction of technology with the potential to provide information with the belief that information behavior , use , and services would evolve ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The second is where intermediaries and information systems were designed and introduced into existing social spaces ( an individual 's home , community center , or street ) with the explicit intention of providing information ."
Research questions	The intention of both implementations was to reduce social exclusion .
Research method	This exploratory research used activity theory as a theoretical lens to explore end-user reaction .
Research findings/conclusions	The Research findings/conclusions of the research illustrate how information and service needs are now addressed through a combination of mobile information and communication technologies and human intermediary knowledge .
Research findings/conclusions	The results show that a very small number of indicators may lead to a robust prediction of about 75 % of the cases .
Research method	We start with 12 indicators to build a few composite indicators by factor analysis .
Research method	"Following a discrete choice model , we arrive at 3 comparatively good predicative models ."
Research findings/conclusions	We conclude that these models have a surprisingly good predictive power and may help peers in their selection process .
Research method	"Using B. Dervin 's ( 1983 ) theory of sense-making applied to crises and communications during crises , we examined 7,184 microblogging communications sent in response to three violent crises that occurred on U.S. college campuses ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The analysis of patterns of microblogging communications found that information-sharing behaviors dominated the early response phase of violent crises , and opinion sharing increased over time , peaking in the recovery phase of the crises ."
Research findings/conclusions	The analysis of individual microblogging communications identified various themes in the conversation threads that not only helped individual contributors make sense of the situation but also helped others who followed the conversation .
Research findings/conclusions	The results of this study show that microblogging can play a vital role in collective sense-making during crises .
Research questions	"Mayer 's cognitive model was examined , wherein the topic integration process of a user evoked by a visual stimulus can be associated with long-latency ERP components ."
Research method	We determined that long-latency ERP components are suitable for measuring a user 's neuronal response through a literature review .
Research findings/conclusions	"We hypothesized that N300 is specific to the categorization of all shots regardless of topic relevance , N400 is specific for the semantic mismatching process for topic-irrelevant shots , and P600 is specific for the context updating process for topic-relevant shots ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In our experiment , the N400 component led to more negative ERP signals in response to topic-irrelevant shots than to topic-relevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern ."
Research findings/conclusions	P600 elicited more positive ERP signals for topic-relevant shots than for topic-irrelevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern .
Research findings/conclusions	We used discriminant and artificial neural network ( ANN ) analyses to decode video shot relevance and observed that the ANN produced particularly high success rates : 91.3 % from the training set and 100 % from the test set .
Research method	A CSCO event is when 2 course-subjects are taught in the same academic year by the same teacher .
Research method	"A total of 61,856 CSCO events were extracted from the 2010-11 directory of the American Association of Law Schools and used to visualize the structure of law school education in the United States ."
Research method	"Different normalization , ordination ( layout ) , and clustering algorithms were compared and the best performing algorithm of each type was used to generate the final map ."
Research findings/conclusions	Validation studies demonstrate that CSCO produces topic maps that are consistent with expert opinion and 4 other indicators of the topical similarity of law school course-subjects .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This research is the first to use CSCO to produce a visualization of a domain .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"It is also the first to use an expanded , multi-part gold standard to evaluate the validity of domain maps and the intermediate steps in their creation ."
Research findings/conclusions	It is suggested that the framework used herein may be adopted for other studies that compare different inputs of a domain map in order to empirically derive the best maps as measured against extrinsic sources of topical similarity ( gold standards ) .
Research questions	"Complexity is a multifaceted concept , with no single agreed definition ."
Research questions	"There are numerous approaches to defining and measuring complexity and organization , all involving the idea of information ."
Research questions	"Conceptions of complexity , order , organization , and interesting order are inextricably intertwined with those of information ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	Shannon 's formalism captures information 's unpredictable creative contributions to organized complexity ; a full understanding of information 's relation to structure and order is still lacking .
Research findings/conclusions	"Conceptual investigations of this topic should enrich the theoretical basis of the information science discipline , and create fruitful links with other disciplines that study the concepts of information and complexity ."
Research questions	"In this study , we propose and examine the relationship between narcissistic leaders and followers who are prone to experience uncertainty intensely and frequently in general , namely highly anxious followers ."
Research method	We do so by applying machine learning algorithms to account for personality traits in a large sample of leaders and followers on Twitter .
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that highly anxious followers are more likely to interact with narcissistic leaders in general , and male narcissistic leaders in particular ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Finally , we also examined these interactions in the context of highly popular leaders and found that as leaders become more popular , they begin to attract less anxious followers , regardless of leader gender ."
Research findings/conclusions	We interpret and discuss these Research findings/conclusions in relation to previous work and outline limitations and future research recommendations based on our approach .
Research questions	"Providing access to these online resources is costly , and it is difficult both to analyze the value of this content to the institution and to discern those journals that comparatively provide more value ."
Research method	"In this research , we examine 1,510 journals from a large research university library , representing more than 40 % of the university 's annual subscription cost for electronic resources at the time of the study ."
Research method	We utilize a web analytics approach for the creation of a linear regression model to predict usage among these journals .
Research method	We categorize metrics into two classes : global ( journal focused ) and local ( institution dependent ) .
Research findings/conclusions	"Using 275 journals for our training set , our analysis shows that a combination of global and local metrics creates the strongest model for predicting full-text downloads ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our linear regression model has an accuracy of more than 80 % in predicting downloads for the 1,235 journals in our test set ."
Research findings/conclusions	The implications of the Research findings/conclusions are that university libraries that use local metrics have better insight into the value of a journal and therefore more efficient cost content management .
Research method	"A metadata analysis informed by digital forensics and trace ethnography is employed to model the overlapping temporal , format-related , and annotation characteristics present in a corpus of repair manual files crowdsourced during collaborations between volunteer archivists and professional technicians ."
Research method	"The corpus originates within 's Medical Device Repair collection , a trove of more than 10,000 manuals contributed by working technicians in response to the strain placed on their colleagues and institutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The study focuses in particular on the Respiratory Analyzer subcategory of documents , which aid in the maintenance of equipment central to the care of COVID-19 patients experiencing respiratory symptoms ."
Research method	"The 40 Respiratory Analyzer manuals in iFixit 's collection are examined in terms of their original publication date , the apparent status of their original paper copies , the version of PDF used to encode them , and any additional metadata that is present ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Based on these characteristics , the study advances a conceptual model accounting for circulation among multiple technicians , as well as alteration of documents during the course of their lifespans ."
Research method	"To gain an understanding of how quality is evaluated , this systematic review examined 165 articles in which researchers evaluated the quality of consumer-oriented health information on the web against predefined criteria ."
Research findings/conclusions	"It was found that studies typically evaluated quality in relation to the substance and formality of content , as well as to the design of technological platforms ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Attention to design , particularly interactivity , privacy , and social and cultural appropriateness is on the rise , which suggests the permeation of a user-centered perspective into the evaluation of health information systems , and a growing recognition of the need to study these systems from a social-technical perspective ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Researchers used many preexisting instruments to facilitate evaluation of the formality of content ; however , only a few were used in multiple studies , and their validity was questioned ."
Research method	"The quality of content ( i.e. , accuracy and completeness ) was always evaluated using proprietary instruments constructed based on medical guidelines or textbooks ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The evaluation results revealed that the quality of health information varied across medical domains and across websites , and that the overall quality remained problematic ."
Research findings/conclusions	Future research is needed to examine the quality of user-generated content and to explore opportunities offered by emerging new media that can facilitate the consumer evaluation of health information .
Research method	"First , we present an overview of smart city developments with a critical focus on corporatization and platform urbanism ."
Research questions	"We critique Alphabet 's Sidewalk Labs development in Toronto , which faces public backlash from the # BlockSidewalk campaign in response to concerns over not just privacy , but also lack of community consultation , the prospect of the city losing its civic ability to self-govern , and its repossession of public land and infrastructure ."
Research questions	"Second , we explore what a more responsible smart city could look like , underpinned by technological sovereignty , which is a way to use technologies to promote individual and collective autonomy and empowerment via ownership , control , and self-governance of data and technologies ."
Research method	"To this end , we juxtapose the Sidewalk Labs development in Toronto with the Barcelona Digital City plan ."
Research questions	We illustrate the merits ( and limits ) of technological sovereignty moving toward a fairer and more equitable digital society .
Research questions	Yet the introduction of such systems has caused much concern about patients ' information privacy .
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study provides new insights into how privacy concerns play a role in patients ' decisions to permit digitization of their personal health information .
Research method	We conducted an online experiment and collected data from 164 patients who are involved in the nonmandatory EHR adoption in the Netherlands .
Research findings/conclusions	We found that the negative effect of information privacy concerns on patients ' willingness to opt in is influenced by the degree of EHR system interoperability and patients ' ability to control disclosure of their information .
Research findings/conclusions	"The results show that , for a networked EHR system , the negative effect of privacy concerns on opt-in behavior was reinforced more than for the stand-alone system ."
Research findings/conclusions	The results also suggest that giving patients greater ability to control their information can alleviate their privacy concerns when they make opt-in decisions .
Research findings/conclusions	We discuss the implications of these Research findings/conclusions .
Research method	"By utilizing citation contexts extracted from a large number of full-text publications , each citation or publication is represented by a probability distribution over a set of predefined topics , where each topic is labeled by an author-contributed keyword ."
Research method	We then used publication/citation topic distribution to generate a citation graph with vertex prior and edge transitioning probability distributions .
Research method	The publication importance score for each given topic is calculated by PageRank with edge and vertex prior distributions .
Research method	"To evaluate this work , we sampled 104 topics ( labeled with keywords ) in review papers ."
Research method	"The cited publications of each review paper are assumed to be important publications for the target topic ( keyword ) , and we use these cited publications to validate our topic-ranking result and to compare different publication-ranking lists ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Evaluation results show that full-text citation and publication content prior topic distribution , along with the classical PageRank algorithm can significantly enhance bibliometric analysis and scientific publication ranking performance , comparing with term frequency-inverted document frequency ( tf-idf ) , language model , BM25 , PageRank , and PageRank + language model ( p < .001 ) , for academic information retrieval ( IR ) systems ."
Research questions	"Many online communities of practice have provided a virtual Internet platform for members to create , collaborate , and contribute their expertise and knowledge ."
Research questions	"To date , we still do not fully understand how members evaluate their knowledge-sharing experiences , and how these evaluations affect their decisions to continue sharing knowledge in online communities of practice ."
Research questions	"In this study , we examined why members continue to share knowledge in online communities of practice , through theorizing and empirically validating the factors and emergent mechanisms ( post-knowledge-sharing evaluation processes ) that drive continuance ."
Research questions	"Specifically , we theorized that members make judgments about their knowledge-sharing behaviors by comparing their normative expectations of reciprocity and capability of helping other members with their actual experiences ."
Research method	We empirically tested our research model using an online survey of members of an online community of practice .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our results showed that when members found that they receive the reciprocity they expected , they will feel satisfied ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Likewise , when they found that they can help other members as they expected , they will feel satisfied and their knowledge self-efficacy will also be enhanced ."
Research findings/conclusions	Both satisfaction and knowledge self-efficacy further affect their intention to continue sharing knowledge in an online community of practice .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"We expect this study will generate interest among researchers in this important area of research , and that the model proposed in this article will serve as a starting point for furthering our limited understanding of continuance behaviors in online communities of practice ."
Research method	Such journals are labeled predatory journals .
Research method	This study examines author profiles for some of these predatory journals as well as for groups of more well-recognized open access journals .
Research method	"We collect and analyze the publication record , citation count , and geographic location of authors from the various groups of journals ."
Research method	Statistical analyses verify that each group of journals has a distinct author population .
Research findings/conclusions	"Those who publish in predatory journals are , for the most part , young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries ."
Research findings/conclusions	We believe that economic and sociocultural conditions in these developing countries have contributed to the differences found in authorship between predatory and nonpredatory journals .
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Most studies in the field use variants of dictionary-based surname methods to identify ethnic communities , an approach that suffers from methodological limitations ."
Research method	"Using the public file of ORCID ( Open Researcher and Contributor ID ) identifiers in 2015 , we developed a surname-based identification method and applied it to infer Russian heritage from suffix-based morphological regularities ."
Research method	The method was developed conceptually and tested in an undersampled control set .
Research method	Identification based on surname morphology was then complemented by using first-name data to eliminate false-positive results .
Research findings/conclusions	The method achieved 98 % precision and 94 % recall rates-superior to most other methods that use name data .
Research findings/conclusions	The procedure can be adapted to identify the heritage of a variety of national groups with morphologically regular naming traditions .
Research value/outlook/limitations	We elaborate on how the method can be employed to overcome long-standing limitations of using name data in bibliometric datasets .
Research findings/conclusions	"This identification method can contribute to advancing research in scientific mobility and migration , patenting by certain groups , publishing and collaboration , transnational and scientific diaspora links , and the effects of diversity on the innovative performance of organizations , regions , and countries ."
Research questions	"In this paper we explore the idea of structural patterns in XML vocabularies , by examining the characteristics of elements as they are used , rather than as they are defined ."
Research method	"We introduce from the ground up a formal theory of 8 plus 3 structural patterns for XML elements , and verify their identifiability in a number of different XML vocabularies ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	The results allowed the creation of visualization and content extraction tools that are completely independent of the schema and without any previous knowledge of the semantics and organization of the XML vocabulary of the documents .
Research method	"Based on a collection of ISI- and non-ISI-indexed articles in the areas of business and computer science , three classification models are trained ."
Research method	A sensitivity analysis is applied to demonstrate the impact of words in different syntactical forms on the classification decision .
Research findings/conclusions	The results demonstrate that the lexical domains of ISI and non-ISI articles are distinguishable by machine learning techniques .
Research findings/conclusions	Our Research findings/conclusions indicate that the support vector machine identifies ISI-indexed articles in both disciplines with higher precision than do the Naive Bayesian and K-Nearest Neighbors techniques .
Research questions	"One tool in particular , social bookmarking systems ( SBSs ) , allows users to store and share links to different types of resources , i.e. , websites , videos , images ."
Research method	"To identify and classify these resources so that they can be retrieved and shared , fragments of text are used ."
Research method	"These fragments of text , usually words , are called tags ."
Research questions	A tag that is found on the inside of a resource text is referred to as an obvious or explicit tag .
Research findings/conclusions	"There are also nonobvious or implicit tags , which do n't appear in the resource text ."
Research questions	The Research questions of this article is to describe the present situation of the SBSs tool and then to also determine the principal features of and how to use explicit tags .
Research findings/conclusions	It will be taken into special consideration which HTML tags with explicit tags are used more frequently .
Research questions	Yet little quantitative evidence has portrayed the landscape and trends of such collaboration .
Research method	"To this end , 14,000,000 documents indexed in Thomson Reuters 's Web of Science ( WoS ) were studied to provide a state-of-the-art description of scientific collaborations across the world ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results indicate that the number of authors in the largest research teams have not significantly grown during the past decade ; however , the number of smaller research teams has seen significant increases in growth ."
Research findings/conclusions	"In terms of composition , the largest teams have become more diverse than the latter teams and tend more toward interinstitutional and international collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	Investigating the size of teams showed large variation between fields .
Research findings/conclusions	Mapping scientific cooperation at the country level reveals that Western countries situated at the core of the map are extensively cooperating with each other .
Research findings/conclusions	High-impact institutions are significantly more collaborative than others .
Research findings/conclusions	"This work should inform policy makers , administrators , and those interested in the progression of scientific collaboration ."
Research method	"Our focus is on four highly specialized disciplines at the boundaries of computer science that emerged during that time : computational linguistics , bioinformatics , digital construction , and microelectronics ."
Research method	Our analysis is driven by the question whether these disciplines develop a distinctive language use-both individually and collectively-over the given time period .
Research method	"The data set is the English Scientific Text Corpus ( SCITEX ) , which includes texts from the 1970s/1980s and early 2000s ."
Research method	Our theoretical basis is register theory .
Research method	"In terms of methods , we combine corpus-based methods of feature extraction ( various aggregated features [ part-of-speech based ] , n-grams , lexico-grammatical patterns ) and automatic text classification ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The results of our research are directly relevant to the study of linguistic variation and languages for specific Research questionss ( LSP ) and have implications for various natural language processing ( NLP ) tasks , for example , authorship attribution , text mining , or training NLP tools ."
Research method	We consider the rationales used by participants in deletion discussions on Wikipedia in terms of the literature on democratic and online deliberation and collaborative information quality .
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions suggest that most participants in these discussions were concerned with the notability and credibility of the topics presented for deletion , and that most presented rationales rooted in established site policies ."
Research findings/conclusions	We found that factors like article topic and unanimity ( or lack thereof ) were among the factors that tended to affect the outcome of the debate .
Research findings/conclusions	Our results also suggested that the blackout of the site in response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act ( SOPA ) law affected the decisions of deletion debates that occurred close to the event .
Research questions	We conclude by suggesting implications of this study for broader considerations of online information quality and democratic deliberation .
Research questions	"In academia , successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing , but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science .
Research method	"Using this perspective , we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions : degree of transdisciplinarity , difference in coauthor 's scientific age and their scientific impact , and research-team size ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Contrary to traditional wisdom , our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers ."
Research findings/conclusions	"We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications , and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions ."
Research findings/conclusions	We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impactpapers .
Research findings/conclusions	"These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success , a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers , funding agencies , policy makers , and mentor-mentee program directors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Moreover , the methodology in this study showcases a feasible approach to measure persistent collaboration ."
Research findings/conclusions	"This has been marketed as a possible gradual transition path between subscription and open access to the scholarly journal literature , and the publishers have pledged to decrease their subscription prices in proportion to the uptake of the hybrid option ."
Research findings/conclusions	"The number of hybrid journals has doubled in the past couple of years and is now over 4,300 ; the number of such articles was around 12,000 in 2011 ."
Research findings/conclusions	"On average only 12 % of eligible authors utilize the OA option , due mainly to the generally high price level of typically 3,000 USD ."
Research findings/conclusions	"There are , however , a few publishers and individual journals with a much higher uptake ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article takes a closer look at the development of hybrid OA and discusses , from an author-centric viewpoint , the possible reasons for the lack of success of this business model ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"This article fills this gap by examining information behaviors of international newcomer students during adjustment to local environments , that is , local information behavior ( LIB ) ."
Research method	"Drawing on prior work , we focus on the local co-national context-the degree to which there are co-nationals available in one 's local environments-to analyze the LIBs of 149 first-year graduate students and 57 follow-up interviewees , who were classified into : International-common group ( students from China , India , and Korea-with many local co-nationals ) , International-less-common group ( students from other countries-with fewer local co-nationals ) , and Domestic-out-of-state group ( students from other U.S. states ; control group ) ."
Research findings/conclusions	We identify differences in international newcomer students ' use of information sources during adjustment and the role that local co-national contexts play in these differences .
Research findings/conclusions	These results suggest ways that information scholars and practitioners might account for the influences of local co-national contexts when examining information behaviors of internationally mobile students and designing systems and services for newcomers from around the world .
Research questions	"One of the fundamental problems in this field is to find a connection between the entity in a query and the potential intents of the users , the latter of which would further reveal important information for facilitating the users ' future actions ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"In this article , we present a novel research method for mining the actionable intents for search users , by generating a ranked list of the potentially most informative actions based on a massive pool of action samples ."
Research method	"We compare different search strategies and their combinations for retrieving the action pool and develop three criteria for measuring the informativeness of the selected action samples , that is , the significance of an action sample within the pool , the representativeness of an action sample for the other candidate samples , and the diverseness of an action sample with respect to the selected actions ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our experiment , based on the Action Mining ( AM ) query entity data set from the Actionable Knowledge Graph ( AKG ) task at NTCIR-13 , suggests that the proposed approach is effective in generating an informative and early-satisfying ranking of potential actions for search users ."
Research questions	News providers are therefore interested in attaining higher visitor rates and promoting greater engagement with their content .
Research findings/conclusions	One aspect of engagement deals with keeping users on site longer by allowing them to have enhanced click-through experiences .
Research questions	News portals have invested in ways to embed links within news stories but so far these links have been curated by news editors .
Research findings/conclusions	"Given the manual effort involved , the use of such links is limited to a small scale ."
Research questions	"In this article , we evaluate a system-based approach that detects newsworthy events in a news article and locates other articles related to these events ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our system does not rely on resources like Wikipedia to identify events , and it was designed to be domain independent ."
Research method	"A rigorous evaluation , using Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , was performed to assess the system-embedded links against the manually-curated ones ."
Research findings/conclusions	"Our Research findings/conclusions reveal that our system 's performance is comparable with that of professional editors , and that users find the automatically generated highlights interesting and the associated articles worthy of reading ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Our evaluation also provides quantitative and qualitative insights into the curation of links , from the perspective of users and professional editors ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	"Up to now , bibliometric research has concerned itself primarily with the calculation of percentiles ."
Research value/outlook/limitations	This study suggests how percentiles ( and percentile rank classes ) can be analyzed meaningfully for an evaluation study .
Research method	Publication sets from four universities are compared with each other to provide sample data .
Research findings/conclusions	"These suggestions take into account on the one hand the distribution of percentiles over the publications in the sets ( universities here ) and on the other hand concentrate on the range of publications with the highest citation impactthat is , the range that is usually of most interest in the evaluation of scientific performance ."
