### Entity

**（1）Research Questions**

Research problem refers to the problem that the article aims to solve. The research question here refers to the sentence indicating the literature research question in the academic full-text.

 

```
Example1:10.1002/asi.22617-2-24 Now , we come to the main point of our article , namely , the relation between the h-index h and the impact factor IF ( average number of citations per publication ) in the shifted Lotka model .

Example2:10.1002/asi.22618-1-8 The purpose of this article is to report the development and the evaluation of an automated semantic annotation system ( called CharaParser ) that is designed to overcome the scalability problem in manual annotation and to promote adaptability of the system across various taxon groups .

Example3:10.1002/asi.22622-1-12 This article focuses on these ill-defined information contexts <cit> , where it aims at presenting a method and tool for information slaves to become emancipated from masters ' attempts to dictate a truth .
```

 

**（2）Research Methods**

Research methods refer to methods, tools, means, technologies, and solutions for solving problems in the application field. The research method here refers to the sentence indicating the literature research method in the academic full-text.

 

```
Examples1:10.1002/asi.22638-2-9 Another approach is to focus on a small subset of websites to build a linking subgraph based on the small websites subset as vertices , and specifying the edges between these websites

Examples2:110.1002/asi.22620-2-37 The visibility of the articles was analysed through a normalization of the citation per paper .

Examples3:110.1002/asi.22620-2-6 Topic searches are a common technique used to analyse growth and trends in the scientific literature of specific subject areas .

**（3）Research Results**

The research results refer to the results and conclusions drawn from the experiment in the article. The research results here refer to the sentences that indicate the literature research results in the academic full-text.

 

```
Examples1:110.1002/asi.22617-4-2 In this article , we presented , based on a shifted power model , an implicit relation between the h-index and the total number of sources , and between the h-index and the impact factor ( average number of items per source ) .

Examples2:110.1002/asi.22617-4-3 In this way , we extended earlier work to the case that the impact factor can have a value lower than one .

Examples3:110.1002/asi.22617-4-4 Although the relation between the h-index and the impact factor looks roughly linear , their relation ( in the shifted power model ) is not linear at all .

```

**（5）Citation Author**

Citation author refers to the name of the author of the cited document.

**（12）Tools**

In general, tools refer to various software toolkits that are currently available for direct use. In this study, we refer to this subcategory of knowledge entities as "software tools". It includes statistical analysis software, information metrology, scientific metrology and visualization software tools, natural language processing tools, programming languages, etc.
